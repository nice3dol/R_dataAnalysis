academic/researcher/smarty-pants consultant but i grew up decidedly
working class. (this unusual path provided me with vast and odd
experiences, able to touch both earth and sky.) this means i can
hold my own in most conversations and clean up well after rolling
in the compost pile or stumbling out of the woods. i'm eternally
curious: sometimes serious, sometimes playful, sometimes wicked,
often quirky, but always reflective about our collective
soup.<br />

friends refer to me as ""unique"" and ""sensitive,"" with a fine nose

intellectual honesty and kindness. i can be intense, although other
intense people experience me as laid back. odd.<br />
stuff: biking, hiking, nature, movies, theater, learning spanish,
camping, bohemian places with good tea and live music, libraries,

transitioning from painful self-promotion and reading tea leaves to
doing research for a new novel set in patagonia. the rest of my

work a silly job that's physical, mindless, and social: i find it
helps balance the solitary work of a writer.","i spent most of my life helping people understand complex systems.

swerve into the bike lane: it scares the hell out of them. (i'd
rather use my smaller bluesy voice when noodling on a guitar
though.) lately i've been on the other side of the mic, having
produced a cd of spoken word and music for a local poet and an
audio-book that i sound-designed and scored. (i love radio

independent/alternative/foreign rather than big and shiny us,
although i'm not above something large and sentimental. i'm a
sucker for great dialogue like who's afraid of virginia wolfe?.
there are some great tv series as well like, six feet under,
justified, and my all-time favorite: the wire. i suspect i could
get hooked on downtown abbey.<br />

a lot about blues history.) that's why i love david byrne radio. i
also like streaming all songs considered 24/7. enjoy world cafe.

smatterings of funk and rockabilly, also some standards. i

my boss says i am a walking paradox: i live in california but i
like the snow, i love watching reality cooking shows but can?t
cook, am the token asian in the office but loves hockey and rock
music, loves tattoos but goes out of my way to hide my own, loves
cars but tells people i ride a moped, used to be in sales but moved
to operations, and looks to be an obnoxious, loud, and uneducated
punk but am actually educated, quiet, and a very humble dork?<br />
<br />
so who the heck am i? well, i do have to agree with my boss and
consider myself a big dork and a goof ball. i have kiddie toys all
over my window sill at work (from coworker?s kids). i sign work
documents with a happy face. i am goofy as often as i possibly can,
i have the strangest fascination to collect all sorts of cleaning
products and air fresheners, i watch all the learning channels
(discovery, thc, tlc, a&amp; e...), wec, hell?s kitchen, idol, and
i like rock music ... =)<br />
<br />
in person, i am very humble. online, i think people have to put
their best qualities forward as people quickly browse for things
they look for in a partner.<br />
<br />
so, here it is?<br />
i have seen enough so far in life to consider myself very 'street
smart.' i have accomplished enough through the educational system
to consider myself very 'book smart' (ba in psych, mba in bus.
admin). so overall, i consider myself well versed... =) although
very goofy, i am very mature during serious times and will take
charge when the situation arises.<br />
<br />
i know exactly what i want in my life; romantically,
professionally, personally, physically, and emotionally. things i
look for: intelligence, faithful, humor, spunk, fit, believes in
aliens, quirkiness, believes in ghosts, worldly, compromising, and
non-materialistic. i really would also like to find someone who is
open to volunteer work; i've volunteered at food banks and soup
kitchens in the past and would really like to do it again. i also
try to avoid drama at all costs. i have lived and loved, and now at
this stage of my life i would definitely like to find that 'one'
right, special someone to hopefully start a future with? just have
not been lucky enough to have met that person yet... =) not really
interested in casual dating, and would like to find someone serious
for hopefully a long term relationship.<br />

i am thankful that you have taken a few minutes out of your life to
get to know what i am all about. drop me a line, and if not, best
of luck to you in your search! =)<br />

by the way, for those who do not know... pleasant hill is a 'small'
town (1 freeway exit) near walnut creek and concord... not to be
confused with pleasanton... =) hehe. to make things more confusing,
i was born a subject of the queen and was a british citizen up
until i was 15, as i was born in hong kong; grew up with my friends

part punkrock. it may be true. i laugh a lot, and have a deep
fetish for the absurd. i've wandered around in ethiopia, mexico,
barcelona, and brazil, and i desperately want to go to nepal and
vietnam. i've lived in portland, michigan, geneva, and all around
the bay area from forestville to san jose. oakland is the greatest
place i've ever lived (with forestville and penngrove as close
seconds). after finishing grad school in 2006 in michigan, i
returned here for a job doing environmental policy and education. i
still have the same gig. it keeps me way too busy, but it's
inspiring. things that make me grin uncontrollably include live
jazz, the ocean, tom waits and david byrne, figs, dancing, the who,
woodworking, mark twain, cheap mexican beer, charlie parker, dr.
john, summer festivals, climbing trees, big dogs, tomatoes and
strawberries right off the plant when they're perfectly ripe and
the sun's been on them for a couple hours, the size of the
universe. while we're loosely on the subject of tomatoes: i
consider it blasphemy to eat them in february. seriously,
people!<br />
<br />
i can be incredibly irreverent, although i'm not a big fan of
negative humor. i'm a logophile and a luddite. i don't like sports,
tv, or identity politics. exceptions to the foregoing: soccer is
cool; sesame street, dr. who, bill moyers, and rachel maddow all
rock (see above mention of being at least 1/3 nerd); and i will
almost always give a couple of bucks to a homeless person if they
look like a veteran.<br />
<br />
i generally prefer sun to shade, outside to inside, purple to blue,
savory to sweet, spicy to mild, cleverness to precision, and good
writing to hasty. i prefer a healthy mix of honest self reflection,
humor, and politeness to strident political correctness. i prefer
burning man to sports (huge understatement).<br />

some people might consider odd incongruities (a decent meditation
practice, and a tendency to drink tequila and dance all night; an
extremely professional job managing a government program, and
burning man; an emphasis on being positive and always seeing the
good in people, and a great love of violent and dystopian movies).","books: the unbearable lightness of being, anything by mark twain,

here it goes. i was born and raised in mexico but at the tender age
of 16 i moved to the us. for a couple of years i lived with my
grandparents in a small town in the central valley, here in
california. there i attended high school but the summers are too
hot for me, so a few months after graduation i traded the hot
temperatures for the fog and moved to san francisco. i still think

ba on political economy and a minor in public policy.<br />

jumping and stuff like that. by the way, if you haven't bungee

unbelievable feeling being weightless watching the world get closer

going to fall and die, you bounceback up. i highly reccommend you

i've met some of my best friends on okc, but i don't come on often
anymore. these days, i am very busy... seeking my happiness in the
real world instead of the internetz. however, i meet the best
people on the internet!!!!! and i definitely want more open-minded,
awesome people in my life. you are more than welcome to message me,
but please don't take it personally if i don't get back to you
because i'm just not really on here.<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />

<br />
i am open-minded and rarely offended by ""offensive"" things.<br />
<br />
i love san francisco. there are still many places here i want to
explore. muni is my best friend even when it sucks. i'm from the
east bay (concord) originally, but i have determined that i am a
big city kind of girl, and i'm on a mission to eventually check out
many of them. i am young and restless and my future can be
anything... i'm always hopeful, and that's something i love about
myself.<br />
<br />
i am very excitable and fun but i can also be quiet.. i'm an only
child, very good at entertaining myself, don't always have to be
around people. i'm comfortable doing a lot of things alone, like
going out to eat or wandering the city. but i also love having
adventures with friends, and i love those crazy conversations when
you just have that amazing mutual omg we're so awesome..
thing.<br />
<br />
i like going to concerts &amp; music festivals, watching movies
&amp; live theater, learning guitar chords, finding thrift shop
treasures, playing ping-pong &amp; rock band, dancing, karaoke,
frolicking in parks, eating delicious things (i don't understand
girls who don't eat), staying up late, sleeping, cuddling, making
collages/scrapbook style art, video/audio editing, creative
writing, boobs.<br />
<br />
i love traveling in general... there are so many places to go. i've
had amazing trips to nyc and portland, or... i really want to go
again. also curious about chicago, asheville, london, just to name
a few.<br />
<br />
i'm a huge grammar-geek (and i will proofread your papers for fun)
but i hate typing correctly online. not sure why i'm doing it right
now. capital letters are obnoxious.<br />
<br />
i love reading.. i wish i had the time to curl up between the pages
more often... i just want more time for everything i want to
do!<br />
<br />
describe me in 3 words: i am curious, wandering, and whimsy!","just finished my bachelor's degree in television &amp; radio at
sfsu. making documentaries, video editing, radio shows and lots of
other exciting things!!<br />
<br />
my dream job: working with others on awesome projects, blending our
creative juices into a beautiful punchbowl of emotions and meaning.
i would like to have a meaningful career of media and social
consciousness. i love documentary work because there are so many
worthy and important stories to tell. it looks like this will be
more of a hobby than a career, but i know it will be a part of my
future.<br />
<br />
i work part-time as a phone outreach fundraiser for an anti-war
grassroots action nonprofit organization, focusing on nuclear
reduction efforts, ending the wars in the middle east, and lobbying
in congress. i am constantly interacting with passionate,
intelligent, proactive people who care about peace, and i love
everything about it.<br />
<br />
i guess my philosophy of life is.. being open to anything, being
passionate about what matters, trying to be physically and mentally
healthy and happy, and appreciating good people &amp; things. i
want to learn and love and experience the world. i like singing and
dancing whenever the mood strikes.","being awkward &amp; ridiculous. giving hugs. petting cats. writing.
listening. rocking out!!!","my answer here used to be pink hair!!!... but that was a long time
ago... anyway, i suppose that what people notice is my voice. i've
been told that it is quite distinctive, and sometimes i get
recognized for it because i used to dj at 90.5 the edge :)","one favorite author is francesca lia block.. i love books that flow
like lyric-poetry and make you feel. i also really dig kurt
vonnegut for the beauty of thoughtful ideas and simple language. i

42,"average","","rarely","sometimes","graduated from ph.d program","i really like the phrase ""kindred spirit"" - it conveys the sense of
deeply connected, equal-yet-different, multi-dimensionally
compatible partnership that i find most important in a loving
relationship. on the other hand, i am quite ambivalent about
phrases like ""my better half"", ""split-apart"" and ""soul-mate"". i
appreciate the romantic aspects of these phrases, but very much
dislike the implication that individuals need someone else to
""complete them"".<br />
<br />
rather than a relationship that adds up to one, i prefer
relationships (be they friendships, lovers, or all-dimensionally
involved partnerships) that add up to *more* than *two*. that is, i
am looking for individuals who are already ""complete"" by themselves
who want to connect with another ""complete"" person to create
something greater than the sum of our selves. and i am looking for
self-awareness, introspection, radical honesty and
communicativeness, as these traits are very important to me.<br />
<br />
so far, this profile sounds quite standard, right? but i have not
yet described what my ideal kindred spirit is like, and (sadly) i
can easily imagine that what i am looking for is in a different
direction than what you are looking for - let's see :-)<br />
<br />
i am simply not wired the way most people are when it comes to
interpersonal relationships. i do not agree with the near-universal
belief that the only kind of romantic relationship that works is
one that precludes the individuals involved from also being
romantically involved with others. i do not believe that one must
limit the number of people one loves to ""the one"", and i don't
agree that monogamy is the only viable means of obtaining long-term
mutual happiness. i am looking for many things - friends, activity
partners, lovers, and/or all-dimensionally involved kindred spirits
- who are interested in deep, sincere, authentic, honest
connections with me *and* with others.<br />
<br />
did i lose you on this last paragraph? :-) i completely understand
if i did, as my philosophy is certainly not traditional. i'll be
very surprised if i hear from anyone who feels the same. i am,
however, happy to develop kindred friendships while i search for
kindred spirits.<br />

satisfaction than for the money. freedom to take 11 weeks in europe
 9 weeks in bologna studying italian. i really love italy and will
always want to spend some time here. i would certainly hope that
you like it too but it's not essential. sometimes we could be apart
for awhile. sometimes absence can indeed make the heart grow fonder
and give us both space.","learning, learning,learning. how else can you enjoy life? btw the

eating meat about a year and a half ago. first, only beef, but

judaism (and to keep kosher). i love the taste of good food,

hi, my name is krish parikh. i'm originally from dallas, spent
several years out in boston for school (mit), and currently call
san francisco my home.<br />
<br />
in a nutshell, i'm a southern gentleman who treats women with
respect and really believes in honesty in relationships. i'm not
sure i can paraphrase what i'm looking for, it's really all about
chemistry. i'm generally attracted to women who are laid back,
sincere, and intelligent.<br />
<br />
a little more about me<br />
i'm into cooking, road cycling, and most sports. i also love to
travel...experiencing local culture and cuisine is one of my
favorite things. i've been fortunate enough to live in europe while
researching at cambridge. my interest in cycling came about after
seeing lance win his 3rd tour de france on the champs elysees. i
bought my car in germany and drove around central europe
ridiculously fast on the autobahns during the '06 world cup. i went
to beijing before the olympics and had an amazing time eating food
i could not pronounce. recently i've been taking a lot of latin
trips...costa rica, cancun, cabo. my short-term wish list includes
south america and africaand one day i would like to see japan and
the middle-east.<br />
<br />
a little about you...<br />
i'm attracted to a woman with a gorgeous smile and a great
personality, someone who can hold a conversation about almost
anything and have fun almost anywhere.<br />
<br />
i tend to go for classic women, those who like to get dressed up
every once in a while to go dancing or out for cocktails. bonus
points if you own a little black dress =) but i really think
chemistry and strong moral values are more important than external
beauty.","i'm currently a vice president at the venture capital firm (we
invest in technology startups like living social). before that, i
spent my days working on strategy and business partnerships for a
software startup in the valley called box.net. while i enjoy what i
do, i dream of giving it all up to be a chef one day...","my friends would say my desserts hit the spot. people always ask me
when they can come over for some tasty bites, so i take that as a
good sign =p i've even won a couple of culinary competitions in my
daybut it'll be up to you to decide.","there is a certain je nais se quois about being a southern boy. the
one thing i do know, however, is that we are all gentleman. we're
friendly to strangers, try to offer a helping hand whenever
possible, and always hold the door open for a lady.<br />

i'm easy going and tend to assimilate well with different types of
people. i can transition between corporate jargon and gujarati with
ease. i'm also a nerd at heart and love geeky explanations,
gadgets, and intelligent conversation.","if i had to pick a favorite type of film, it'd probably be romantic

godson is into all of this, and i'm into spending time with him.
basically, if it has swords, castles, and anything medieval or
ancient, we're there. we even saw wrath of the titans, which was
gawd-awful. i trust liam neeson and ralph fiennes were well-paid
for lending their stature and skills, which were not quite enough
to redeem this mess.<br />
<br />
just saw salmon fishing in yemen (with above-mentioned godson) and
loved it. a fun, oddball story well told, with interesting
characters and great cinematography.<br />
<br />
tv shows: boardwalk empire, the wire, mad men, curb your
enthusiasm, rome, deadwood, justified, game of thrones. i never
quite got into breaking bad. wonderful acting but it's just so
dark...<br />
<br />
food-wise, i'm an omnivore skewing toward the healthy end of the
spectrum (not a lot of fried stuff). i grew up in a time and place
where spicy-hot was the exception rather than the rule. i've
learned to enjoy mild to medium mexican and thai, but super
spicy-hot still ain't for me -- which leaves more for you.","music, humor, my 3 godchildren, great friends, meditation, good
food, chocolate<br />

(obviously, math didn't make the cut)","well... how much time do you have?","good chance i'm doing one of these three: playing for a samba dance
class in sf in the early evening, having dinner with friends, or
working late and then hitting the gym (one reason i'm on this
site).","(1) i attended a wwe live show (okay, two of them) with my godsons
when they were younger. (2) for a little while i enjoyed watching

with the family and a cadre of old friends one of whom labeled me

come off as somewhat pretentious and not really that nice.<br />
so far i have lost a lot of money on drugs, but i have lost more
money lending books to friends. i work in a kitchen, which means i
curse a lot, hang out with jocks who make fun of how nerdy i am,
and can drink many beers in a row. i now also work in the wine
industry which despite it being a slimy amoral world, obsessed with
a closed set of fundamentally useless knowledge and plagued with
elitism does in fact have some negative parts. i grew up in oakland
and as a result i am always conscious about things that may get
stolen. sometimes books put me into the same state that people get
into on cocaine, where i blow off my friends because i just want to
read one more chapter, and one more and one more, and this will go
on for hours. funny is the most important quality in friends. i am
always surprised by how much of an impression visual art makes on
me, agnes martin broke my heart a little bit. i used to go to
boxing classes many hours a week and it left me with a certain
jumpy anxiety that someone was going to hit me and make math way
harder for the rest of my life. i try and take photographs as much
as i can, right now i am really into portraits, which is some total
photo 1 shit, but whatever i didn't go to art school i'm figuring
out all this cliche stuff on my own. i don't really scar, but this
is boring, i only wrote it down because staring at my face i
realized there's no way to tell i broke my nose and reset it in a
warehouse bathroom; i feel a little cheated that's all. i've spent
the last few months teaching myself guitar from the hours of 1am to
4am. this should reveal two things 1. i am not very good 2. i am
not a morning person. i am honestly about 9 years old inside and
cynical as hell.<br />
i am totally jawesome, hungry, and vaguely neurotic.<br />

note to those interested: recently i have been spending more time
involved in political/literary projects. as a result i'm busier and

me:<br />
<br />
i moved to san francisco from philadelphia in the summer of 2009
after finishing my medical training in philadelphia. i moved here
because i have family here (my sister, brother-in-law, and niece),
and because i really like the area! i missed seeing sunsets when i
lived in philly.<br />
<br />
i can't say enough about this area! one weekend, i'm on this
incredible hike above the fog line and watching reflections of pink
and orange off the cottonball-like clouds from the sunset. the next
weekend, i'm roaming around north beach, china town, and jackson
square, on a city-wide evening treasure hunt with an amazing
chinese new year parade and coursing through fascinated crowds.
this city just has a mystique to it.<br />
<br />
i've got my career. i've worked hard to get to this point, and i
think i lucked out too. i'm making some good friends in my new
city. ultimately, i'm looking for a partner now with whom to share
adventures and perhaps even stand in line with to get ice cream at
bi rite!","i'm fortunate to be able to have exactly the career i've wanted for
myself. i'm a physician, with a solo private practice and i get to

at home. i strive to be a positive upbeat person and according to
friends i seem to achieve that most times. i am independant and

to share things with. i enjoy, day trips, exploring and
experiencing new things, dining out, movies, travel, dancing, live
music/concerts, stage plays etc. i have two dogs that make me laugh
and remind me constantly to not take myself too seriously. i have a
good sense of humor and consider myself to be witty and charming
(people have told me that so i think it is okay to say:) but i have
a serious side as well. i am affectionate, open-minded and
accepting of others and it is important for me to find a partner
that is as well. i absolutely love a good conversation and there is
nothing better than really connecting with a person. i am at a
point in my life where i know myself well...which is vital before
beginning to think about what one is looking for in another person.
i am a work in progress and though i would describe myself as
""passionate"", i am sure that those that know me well might say i
can be stubborn. they would also say i am committed, loyal,
nurturing and a good listener. i can be silly, playful and
vulnerable when i feel comfortable and safe. there are numerous
layers and i have exposed but a few:) i would love to meet someone
who i can laugh with too. i am looking for someone who enjoys some
of the things that i do and who thinks that weekends were made for
visits to the farmer's market, leisurely lunches, day trips that
take us outside of the city and basically slowing down enough to
breathe and truly enjoy the company of another person. conversation
and really connecting are important to me.","continuing to grow, experiencing new things, giving back","listening, counseling, being supportive, baking, expressing myself

open, honest, grounded person. i have an oddly great sense of

to something it can be difficult to change it. although, i am
really good at starting over and feel strongly that it is our life
experiences that help shape us, and it is our (re)actions that make
us who we are. i'm looking to meet someone i could fall in love
with, and most importantly one who sees and loves the real me

connection with an imperfect person.""","i try to live my life as balanced as possible. building my career,

or even hang out sometime. i also have some youtube videos of me
dancing and such. thanks! :)<br />
<br />
hobbies; well i own a horse, his name is thor. i love taking care
of him, and i see him everyday. i love to dance, and listen to
music. i like to be outside, so i walk alot. fitness is a part of
my life and enjoy working out. i run every night, and come home and
tone my muscles. i like to sketch/draw. i usually sketch ""doomsday""
and the ""unknown"", judgment day or the mid-evil era.<br />
<br />
goals; my goal in life is to be content whether i am sharing it
with someone or not. one of my dreams is to be a pilot, i am
strongly considering joining the military. warrant officer, it will
be quite the challenge, but i will certainly not give up! i want to
be happy, and enjoy being who i am. i want to continue riding
horses for the rest of my life, and continue dancing. sometime soon
i want to enter thor and i into a competition. also, it would be
nice to swim regularly again.<br />
<br />
many people ask, why join the military. well obviously everyone is
different. i know myself, and i live off of excitement, extreme
challenges and risks. i need the physical and mental challenge. i
want to be able to adapt to unfamiliar places, to nothing. i have
always admired people in the military and always had this hidden
interest for flying. when i am gone, thor will be taken care of
long term by a leaser. a lot of my friends tell me ""you are going
to leave everything...your home, your horse, your beautiful
city.""<br />
i always say, ""well, that is part of the challenge right? i am
leaving everything to eventually get everything back<br />
and more. it is to find and to be pushed to my ultimate limit.
then, make that ultimate limit my lowest and keep pushing
forward.""<br />
<br />
myself; well, i have been professionally riding horses since i was
11 year old. i have had two horses before during my early teen
years, now i just take care of my number one man thor. i love to
dance, so music is a must. i go out dancing with my sister, i have
to say i have a pretty unique way of dancing. i have a particular
taste in music, i like rock, old rock, classic rock, pop, old pop,
alternative, anything i can dance to. here are my bands; mumford
and sons, lincoln park, cold play, maroon 5, franz ferdinand, muse,
gorillaz, locnville, aha, flock of seagulls, michael jackson and
some others. i have danced modern, ballet (which i'm not too fond
of), jazz and belly dance. yea, i like to flip my hair, dance in
public randomly, i have my weird hyper moments where i want to play
or be feisty, sometimes i can be flirtatiously aggressive. :) i am
not a pro singer, but when i am alone and a song i like happens to
come up i participate ha.<br />
<br />
i am pretty fun to be around, i am random and can be very
spontaneous at times. i like to be challenged, i like to dare
myself into things i have never done before. i like to challenge my
own gut at times :). i am a happy person, i love the things i got
myself doing. i am a caring and lovable, loving person. i am
straight forward and down to earth. i do have my deep random
thoughts, ha, about the ""unknown"", ""what's out there, and what's
over here"" kind of thoughts. only because my worst fear are aliens.
don't get me started on that.<br />
<br />
i can be shy at first, but once i am comfortable i am pretty
outgoing. i like to do new things, i like to laugh out loud, flirt,
i like to be amazed! surprised! i like to do things randomly,
things i normally wouldn't think of and do at all. i am energetic,
enthusiastic, sarcastic, a joker, a dare devil. so, keep up.<br />
<br />
***i am not looking for a relationship, there is no rush for me. i
just want to make friends and hang out. though, if i do end up
liking someone then i'll let things happen on their own. :) i want
someone who is not afraid to be curious, adventurous and bold. the
one thing that i am attracted to the most is a man that is
spontaneous, someone who can make an atmosphere fun out from
nothing. !!!do not!!!...message me if you are the type to go on
dates then just fade away, it is a waste of my time and energy. i
don't have time for fakes, games and flakes. i do not take b.s
lightly nor do i like to ""try again"".*** thanks for reading.<br />

i am tall, cuddly, and have a goofy smile","i'm living it. i work for a living; i try to keep my work enjoyable
enough to not offend me but have long since learned not to define
my life by it. i enjoy trying new things, some activities i keep,
others i explore and then move on. i discovered long ago that i'm
good with <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=computers"">computers</a>, which has informed both my
professional and personal interests: i work in software/<a class=
""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=internet"">internet</a> companies, some
of which you may have heard of, i was an early adopter of computers
as a tool to foment interpersonal communication, which has led to
both my willingness to just pay for the long distance phone call
already, and my late adoption of dating sites.<br />
<br />
i discovered less long ago that i love <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=wine"">wine</a>; i drink wine with <a class=""ilink""
href=""/interests?i=friends"">friends</a> over <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=dinner"">dinner</a>, i run a <a class=""ilink"" href=

every year at fort mason, and i've actually bought grapes and made
a barrel of wine from them (twice so far -- too busy this year and
it's gotten much harder to find good grapes or good, affordable
barrels).<br />
<br />
most recently, i've rediscovered my inner raver. i organize and
promote a <a class=""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=techno"">techno</a>
dance party with the essential help of my friends, including some
spectacular visual effects by <a class=""plink"" href=

""/interests?i=unity"">unity</a>. <a class=""ilink"" href=

href=""/interests?i=cabernet"">cabernet</a> and a 2006 <a class=
""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=pinot+noir"">pinot noir</a>), though the
style the grapes wanted wasn't my personal favorite, so it's
difficult for me to be sure.<br />
<br />
from the reactions of folks at my dance parties, i'm ready to say i
throw a good one if you like dancing to hard banging beats, killer
visual effects and informal settings.<br />
<br />
i'm also really good at randomly changing the conversation in the
middle of a subject, or bouncing between a couple topics. it's not
that you're boring, it's just how my brain works. feel free to
continue previous subjects.<br />
<br />
my wonderful friends have said i'm a really good friend, though i'm
not really sure what that means. i do watch out for those i care
about.","uhhh, tall cuddly mostly-asian guy with goofy grin. ponytail.
usually has a large messenger bag of stuff at parties.<br />
<br />
sometimes, however, they'll just notice i'm the social one coming
up to say hello. i'm moderately tall (just a touch over 6ft,
wouldn't call it 6'1"" even) and usually either moving or seated;
don't usually see much need to stand in place except as engaged in
conversation, of course.<br />
<br />
i'm willing to participate in most conversations; if i know
something interesting i can contribute; if not i'm happy to learn
from the others.<br />
<br />
oh, and apparently i have a slightly unusual cadence and rhythm in
my voice.<br />
<br />
people seem to think i'm a lot younger than i am. it's actually
kind of funny being told i'm too young for something when i'm older
than the person saying it. whatever, age really is just a number.
and it really only matters when they need to fill out your death
record. as long as my corpse looks good or can't be found, who
cares, right? ;)","can't really say i have a favorite book, movie, music or food,
though i enjoy them all.<br />
<br />
i tend to start off reading 3 completely unrelated books, one gets
put aside early, while one captures me enough i finish it within
the day or two, and the other takes a little longer, falling into
the role of a break away from other parts of life.<br />
<br />
i really enjoy watching movies, alone or with friends, but i'm not
always ready to set aside the couple of hours of life in one place
to watch them unless there's someone to watch with. i have yet to
see most of the movies currently in theater, come to think of it,
so if you're looking for a movie buddy (nothing else required) that
might be enough. i love movies like dancer in the dark even if it
did make me sad enough to cry. if i'm going to bother going, it's
worth considering something like imax at the metron. not sure what
else i will want to see this year.<br />
<br />
i really enjoy music as well, but there's no way i can narrow it
down to favorites. lately it's been all about the dance music,
mostly the clubby and ravey stuff, though mainstream club
selections manage to make even 143bpm boring. i much prefer
smaller, more intimate spaces like anu (where i throw my own party
on the last friday of each month) or places with a little grit like
222 hyde over a big commercial place like temple or ruby skye,
though i'll at least consider those spots if my friends want to go
there. i do like salsa and a lot of other music, but i've never had
a formal dance lesson on my life, and am not quite ready to take
the time to do so now.<br />
<br />
food. mmmmm, foooood. yes, i love food, wonderful food. italian,
chinese, french, german, mexican, indian, sushi (and other
japanese, actually), all good. i'm also a pretty good cook, though
since i moved this last time(soma) i haven't really stocked the
kitchen sufficiently to make much of anything. when i'm able to
cook, i do a lot of soups and stews (my coq au vin's pretty darn
tasty, as is my boeuf bourguignonne, but to do them right takes a
couple days and a lot of space in the fridge), otherwise i prefer
to use high quality ingredients prepared simply, especially since
that gives me more time to spend with interesting company.","(ok, fine, time for usual crap)<br />
my friends: i believe we measure our lives by our friends and the
experiences we build and share with them.<br />
<br />
my family: yeah, i don't see them all that often, but they're still
family, and if you've ever been to a chinese wedding and seen your
90+ year old grand aunt and uncle still on the dance floor after
midnight (keeping in mind the wedding usually starts in the
morning), well, you may understand what a celebration of life
family is.<br />

say... un jour sans vin est comme un jour sans soleil (think i got

<br />
l-tryptophan: essential of essentials...<br />
<br />
dance music: almost entirely electronic at this point, mostly
techno. but most importantly, i gotta be able to dance to it (and
considering my lack of knowledge in dancing, that narrows the field
quite a bit).","where to go from here/what to do next.","getting off work and heading to meet up with friends at somewhere
with a sound system. after that, am likely to want to go somewhere
and do something. you should come too, it'll be fun. afterwards, we
can go somewhere else and do some other thing, some other friends
might be there.","i'm actually even more open in person than i am online. i believe
in honest communication in life so keep few secrets. online, i'm a
touch more private.","you wish to initiate communication and believe this will result in
mutually interested dialogue, if you believe that honest and open

girlfriend. i'm happy outside wandering the beach, curled up with a
book, watching the giants with friends, babysitting my nieces and
turning the living room into a castle, or about 100 other things.

life offers. but before we get there, i'm at least mildly
interesting and wouldn't be a boring date.","trying to figure it out like everyone else and be kind to myself

* writing, except for signing my name. it always looks like a

get everything ready at the same time.<br />

i'll come up with a list that would include almost famous, cinema

fiction or sci fi. recently i enjoyed city of thieves and the help.

gatsby, unbearable lightness of being, never let me go, catch 22,
the stand, to kill a mocking bird, phantom tollbooth, brief
wonderous life of oscar wao, left hand of darkness, hollywood wives
(just threw in the jackie collins to see if you got through the

there's modern family, daily show, and true blood (eye candy). and,
yes, i do own the battlestar galactica series and lost.<br />

my hip friends to get me to a show, like the kings of convenience

i am an intense artistic type, a fine artist with a graphic arts
sensibility, who dreams of working on a commercial fishing vessel,
or a job working with a vandercook printing press.<br />
<br />
i am not afraid to get my hands dirty, which might include various
types of art: from the fine/creative arts to the martial/healing
arts. i have studied/study brazilian jiu-jitsu, capoeira, yoga, and
massage therapy. recently drank the crossfit ""kool-aid,"" which
means getting my ass handed to me, but enjoying the process
nonetheless.<br />
<br />
in the creative arts i particularly enjoy printmaking: reduction
relief is my favorite. i draw, do ceramics, paint, and do mostly
anything, but currently i am getting better at photography. i need
to research studio spaces, i wouldn't mind getting into oil paints
again.<br />
<br />
worms, and dirt don't scare me; sea spray and squid guts were a
part of one of my jobs, ink underneath the fingernails, clay in the
hair and oil paints are all a part of the process. i am perfectly
at home getting fancy and going to a live theater performance, and
also ripping a squid in half.<br />
<br />
i am finding out i am more adventurous than i ever gave myself
credit for. at least in certain aspects of my world. i found out i
am willing to move out a state for a crazy job, and return back (in
this case) to start all over again. i might be giving myself more
credit for things, but, at times mentally hitting myself because i
am not brave enough.<br />
<br />
i find myself listening more than speaking, and letting others take
the limelight. but, although i might not be center stage, i am
certainly not one to be upstaged, and i certainly don't like being
left in the dust. i am a social being who understands the value of
not always being social, a guess you could call me a social
introvert.","trying to figure out where i fit in life, surviving and dreaming.
who ever said being an adult, you would know all the answers, was
lying. i am currently looking for a job, so, i'm conspiring on how
to land another job working on a fishing vessel. imagining the that
the rain hitting my face is the ocean spray. i am creating more
art, which i am currently playing around with gouache pigments and
water soluble pencils. looking for answers, and coming up with more
questions. trying to accomplish goals, holding my head held high.
being me.<br />
<br />
""i'm looking for me,<br />
you're looking for you,<br />
we're looking in at each other,<br />
and we don't know what to do.""<br />
<br />
my goal for this year, is to change, to do something out of my
usual, to feel itchy underneath my skin. to move beyond, ahead, and
forward.","frankly, sometimes, i feel like i am good at nothing. but, people
tell me, i am good at: printmaking, ceramics, and other forms of
fine art, i am trying to improve my photography skills. i am a good
listener. arriving on time. making people laugh... being calm,
present, a supporting factor, a friend. involving people in the
situation. being a diplomat. being the catalyst of change/adventure
usually for the people around me, and shoulder massages.","my interesting jewelry, also my eyes.<br />
<br />
i am an intense individual, by which i mean, i am passionate about
the things that mean something to me. i am not the run of the mill
""girly girl."" though i like being feminine. i like to smile and
laugh. i am shy and outgoing, outgoing and shy. i am quiet and
thoughtful, also outspoken when necessary. i guess you can say, i
am reserved when i first meet people, with a friendly demeanor. i
am a participant. i am an avid learner, i am always curious, i want
to know more, and explore. did i mention, outgoing and shy? i tend
to be cautious/shy of people when i first meet them, but, become
one of my circle of friends, i will fiercely, honorably welcome
you. i am down to earth, with my feet on the ground, but with my
thoughts reaching beyond the stars.<br />

people say ""if you can't beat them, join them"". i say ""if you can't
beat them, beat them"", because they will be expecting you to join
them, so you will have the element of surprise. the main reason
santa is so jolly is because he knows where all the bad girls live.

the early bird might get the worm, but the second mouse gets the
cheese. fighting for peace is like ****ing for virginity. i didn't
fight my way to the top of the food chain to be a vegetarian. a
computer once beat me at chess, but it was no match for me at kick
boxing. i didn't say it was your fault, i said i was blaming you.
women might be able to fake orgasms. but men can fake a whole
relationship. the last thing i want to do is hurt you. but it's
still on the list. having sex is like playing bridge. if you don't
have a good partner, you'd better have a good hand. knowledge is
power, and power corrupts. so study hard and be evil. if god is
watching us, the least we can do is be entertaining.<br />

<br />
i am quiet, contemplative in thought, and my emotions tend to run a
deep course within my self. the idea of surrounding myself with
natural beauty and tranquility in life, is very appealing to me. oh
yeah, i make social awkwardness look adorable.<br />
<br />
adventure, travel and general mischief have quite a hold of
temptation on me. often times, i will get the urge to get up and
go, so i'll get in my car and go for a night drive. i love going to
theme parks with roller coasters, and i would love to jump out of
airplanes someday. skydiving, anyone?<br />
<br />
on the home front, i like to spend leisure time gaming. final
fantasy was especially prominent in my youth, so i tend to favor
the rpg fantasy genre in games.","one month away from shipping off to army basic training. where did
all that time go?","i have inclinations. not entirely sure that i am really good at any
one thing, in particular. um.. once i figure out the notes to an

tend to favor fictional works. there's just something about losing

i'm in the mood to watch. 5 movies:<br />
-""chumscrubber""<br />
-""imagine me and you""<br />
-""jurassic park"" (yes, i'm a sucker for the sci-fi genre, for
better or for worse)<br />
-""a beautiful mind""<br />
-""shutter island/inception"" (i feel like the concepts of these 2
movies isn't so far off, and leonardo dicaprio played troubled
souls in both)<br />
<br />
tv: i hardly watch any tv at all. glee used to be fun to watch,
until the plot went horribly awry and they split santana and
brittany up...<br />

need to take a break and do more writing. for those truly

[end update]</strong><br />
if you get no farther than this: despite having a strong interest
in science, i am an enfp, for those who care and make note of
such.<br />
<br />
i have a weakness for girls with a sharp mind and a sharp wit, and
can fence with both.<br />
<br />
i have an insatiable creative streak, most of which gets channeled
through writing and photography, though i'm also working on an ios
game and in search of someone who can draw better and faster than i
do.<br />
<br />
i like to dance. i love to snuggle. when i travel, i love to take
photos, people watch, and really soak in the culture. actually, i
do that even in the bay area. i take my time when looking at
artwork. i'm extremely tech savvy but can grow awesome tomatoes. i
read everything from history and anthropology to mystery/thrillers
and scifi, the latter of which i've always intended to write but my
first novel is turning out to be a wwii mystery.<br />
<br />
i love the fog or a storm on a rocky coast as much as the
sunshine.<br />
<br />
learning is a lifetime pursuit for me and i have numerous lectures
from the teaching company and love itunes u. every now and again i
work on learning the piano but am usually stumped by a defect in
reading music, though i have learned a few simple tunes by ear.
singing-wise, i can carry a tune but the bucket sloshes.<br />
<br />
i love to get down into the dirt to plant or play but i'm not
""down-to-earth""; i am a dreamer, it's how i make my living and i
work hard to make those dreams a reality both for myself and my
kids. being a dreamer did not prevent me from sending each to the
university of their choice, rather it made it possible. they are
currently working in fields they love, surrounded by friends and
loved ones. john barrymore said, ""a man is not old until regrets
take the place of dreams."" i have no regrets.<br />
<br />
home is wherever we are and whatever we do. i want to be with
someone who feels like home, even if we're in the most remote part
of the world.","making it happen and loving it.","figuring things out. love puzzles. also gingerbread pancakes, from
scratch, usually organic and topped with vermont maple. and yes,
i'll share the recipe. i borrowed the basis from a defunct
restaurant in burlington.","my smile? my eyes? the fact that i look very intently at the person

(enough), and the willingness look at things non-judgmentally.

better solution most definitely leads to more happiness.<br />

last time i came close to having my heart broken, i accomplished
this in about one week. i would be most appreciative if you could
help me with this.<br />
<br />
you might be thinking, ""well, i'm a cad. i can do this in no time.""
but you'd be wrong.<br />
<br />
it takes patience and time and caring.<br />
<br />
first, you need to show me you're an intelligent man with an
upstanding upbringing. you also need to prove to me that you are
creative and humorous. this you could do by taking me to a wide
range of cultural events--from grunge bars to fine dining, from
camping to experiences in europe, from street performers to
opera.<br />
<br />
i would also need to see that you understand the plight of those
less fortunate than yourself and that sexism still exists in this
late age. rather than listen to your diatribes on this, i would
witness it over time as you share in the tasks that make a home
run: cooking, cleaning, shopping, appointment setting, reservations
and planning for our above trips and cultural events, laundry,
etc.<br />
<br />
you will show me that you are willing to work at the problems that
will inevitably pop up between us.<br />
<br />
then of course, there are the shallow qualities you will need to
live up to: you need to be attractive. (i'm not demanding johnny
depp looks or anything, after all i am reasonable.) you need to be
tall. and educated. you need to do something (for a paycheck) that
you enjoy. you need to understand that men with mustaches, except
in the rarest of cases (johnny depp), are inadvertently proving
they are dclass. you have control of your bodily functions and
will not subject me or anyone else in the room to unpleasant sounds
or odors (farting, burping, chewing with your mouth open.) and you
will never, never pose with a car, motorcycle, speed boat, etc. in
the attempt to impress me.<br />
<br />
so, you see, in order to help me lose these 20lbs, no mere cad will
do.<br />

traveling. i have rarely met a dish that i have not liked, and over
the years i have enjoyed a number of vacations and business trips
that have taken me to many amazing places around the world.<br />

when i'm not on the road or in the air, i really enjoy exploring
the local bay area to find new restaurants that serve a variety of
delicious cuisines. they don't have to be fancy or anything; in

that can be best described as the classic hole in the wall!<br />
<br />
while i'm definitely a go-getter at work and really enjoy what i
do, in my personal life i'm much more laid back. life is too short
to worry about anything and everything. my friends would probably
tell you that i'm a pretty independent kind of guy who can be on
the quiet side at first. but once i get to know someone a bit more
and feel like we have some things in common, it won't take long for
me to start talking about all sorts of subjects.","i help create the amazon kindle products.","suggesting places to eat - i remember all the nice restaurants in

what i'm looking for in a woman is someone who can share my
interests in food and travel. the great thing about these two
things is that they often go hand-in-hand; going to other countries
and experiencing a variety of cultures has exposed me to all sorts
of incredible things, including some great new dishes!<br />
<br />
i am definitely attracted to women with beautiful smiles and who
are smart and interested in a variety of topics. i am hoping the
woman i meet will also be open to trying new things, and not be set
in her ways about everything. i once heard a theory that women have
a raw sensuality, but it's difficult for women to express fully -
there are too many societal constraints holding them back. i'd like
to secure a space wherein the woman feels safe to express her true
nature.<br />

back to dating stuff...<br />
<br />
i seem to do better at meeting gals in real life than ok cupid, but
i've known couples who've met on this site so here goes...self
summary? i'm a chivalrous gentleman. y'know, pay for dates, walk on
the side of the sidewalk closest to the street, open doors, if the
dating chemistry is strong at first, but fizzles out, i'm open to
still being friends instead of freaking out like a lot of dudes do.
i ain't a doormat though. ""papa don't take no mess!"" i guess i'll
end it on the james brown quote.","here is the link to the short film bulldog. written and directed by
me. considering the actors have never acted and the camera guy only
did a few interviews in the past, i'm stoked about how it turned
out! if you like a groovy 60's/70's soundtrack juxtaposed with
sadness, anger and violence, the style used by martin scorsese, jim
jarmusch, wes anderson, tarantino, etc. then i think you'll dig it.
if you pay attention to the dialogue, there's even a good message.
i've learned from scorsese that it's best not to beat an audience
over the head with the moral of the story. instead, focus on making
the rest of the content as creative, but real as possible.<br />

i'm currently working on the follow up to bulldog, last of the
faustian men (bonus points if you know where the kerouac quote/lift
is from.) gonna have cooler, creative, camera work in this one. a
professional cinematographer has volunteered his talents. the
script is ten time better than bulldog too, if i do say so
myself.<br />

i love music and i've played the cello since elementary school,
although right now i'm terribly out of practice. i'm hoping to

dance (congolese, swing, salsa, and most recently ballet).<br />

37,"average","strictly vegetarian","not at all","never","graduated from college/university","hi! thanks for looking! here's a june 2012 profile rewrite.<br />
the most significant traits of mine probably are spiritual,
intellectual, creative, compassionate, professional, stable, and
sometimes goofy. i think i have a mix of being really outside the
box and mainstream at the same time.<br />
i'll do my best to explain that on this page!<br />
for summary's sake right here though, i am into spirituality (i
respect all kinds), but my focus is on indian
yoga/meditation.<br />
i love the beauty of nature and music.<br />
i have a big heart, but try to keep it in balance with my
head.<br />
i'm an engineer, so am logical, practical, and careful.<br />
i have a wacky sense of humor and some wit (but sharing either on
an internet profile just doesn't really happen with me).","here's kind of a rundown of where i am and how i got here:<br />
<br />
i spent up to my early twenties mostly focused on exploring music
and nature (jazz, classical, indian classical music), which led me
to an interest in spirituality, mostly eastern philosophies and
native american ways. in my early twenties i started practicing
yoga and meditation regularly (i still do). i also realized at some
point i wanted a career that both would provide a substantial
income and that i would enjoy and would keep me challenged.
realizing i had an innate knack for working with computers, i got
my engineering degree, and started working as a software engineer,
and that is what i do today, and love it.<br />
<br />
in my thirties things slowed down a lot. i've focused on developing
my career and spiritual life further. much different than the
twenties where there was so much moving around, uncertainty. now i
am established in who i am and what i do, and happy with it. things
have been steadily moving in the direction i've hoped.<br />
<br />
note: as i'm writing, thinking about how many times i wrote the
word ""focus""! i'm sure i wanted to write it even more than i did --
the point being i have always had an ability to get extremely
focused, in everything i did. i've tried to leverage that in life.","setting realistic goals and reaching them, solving problems, facing
difficulty calmly, being goofy and playful, understanding people,
cooking, growing and taking care of plants.","it depends on where we meet. probably focus, or that i seem happy
and playful.<br />
this isn't regarding first impressions necessarily, but a close
friend told me recently i'm the most adult person he knows
(probably of his friends and peers, of course!)","when i read it is usually magazines or spiritual books -- i'll flip
through magazines and read whatever grabs my attention. sometimes
stuff about science and technology or economics.<br />
when i have more time, spiritual stuff, like the lives of saints
(of all religions).<br />
<br />
i go through periods of tv or no tv. now no tv. generally not a fan
of cable. i like to watch movies at home or in a theater sometimes.
some favorites: lord of the rings, star wars, the mission, some
things i've seen recently: the king's speech (loved it), avatar
(entertaining and visually cool), true grit. i have a thing for
sci-fi/fantasy, adventure, westerns, or anything uplifting,
especially involving some kind of spiritual story.<br />
<br />
music: anything uplifting, meditative, beautiful. can be all kinds.
some examples: indian classical, native american flute, helen jane
long, ludavico einaudi, steve baughman, anything celtic, some
classical, like vaughn williams, rachmaninoff, and the slower,
calmer works of any composer. i also like alt-country
bluegrass/folk type stuff, and that's fun to see live (like the
freight and salvage).<br />
<br />
i'm vegetarian, and love to cook. also love to eat out. some
favorites are: viks, udupi palace, picante, whole foods hot food,
zachary's, thai, mediterranean, italian (a lot of ethnic types).
most of my favorites are in berkeley.","i am not a very materialistic person. whether or not i could afford
it, i probably wouldn't ever have a fancy car. i do own a home
though, which is a nice comfort. i think this is really just about
levels of comfort. now mine is about where i'd like it to be. i
have enough to be pretty comfortable.","i think about big stuff a fair amount, like environmental issues
(reducing one's footprint, living sustainably), the human
condition, science and technology and spirituality.<br />
friends and family, what is going on in their lives.<br />
<br />
also a note for others into spirituality, or wondering what it is
to me. simply put, the main thing for me is getting beyond ego.
this is reflected in how we treat people -- how we cooperate with
others, work together. i don't know if i need someone who is into
spirituality, but i do need someone who is thoughtful of others and
tries to be the best person they can be.<br />
hopefully you know the golden rule, and try to live by it.<br />
<br />
and a note on having kids. i probably have said somewhere on here
that i want a family, kids. to elaborate, i am looking for a
partner, a companion. hopefully you would be open to having
children, as i think often that is a natural course of things in an
adult relationship, i.e. marriage. it's not that having kids is
something i really dream of and want more than anything, but it
does sound like it would be very rewarding, and i'd welcome it as a
part of my life with the right person at the right time.","winding down, out at a restaurant or relaxing at home, sometimes
with family or friends.<br />
i tend to stay close to home a lot. i always love exploring nature,
either locally or a trip somewhere, but can be content hanging
around near home. with the right person i tend to enjoy trips to
places more.<br />
i wouldn't say i'm an introvert, as i'm comfortable both having
alone time or with people. my social time is mostly with close
friends and my family (2 brothers, 1 sister, and their 6, soon to
be 7 children). parents, aunts, grandparents, as well as 2 of 3
siblings are all nearby.<br />
you might have a large network of friends and a more active social
life, which is fine with me. i just don't need that for me, it
isn't my thing, but i would probably be up for being a part of that
more with a partner.","the things here really. of course more to share if we click.<br />
<br />
also, not sure if this is the right box for this, but some notes on
dietary preferences and alcohol use, since you probably noticed i'm
vegetarian and don't drink.<br />
i'm vegetarian because it works for me, especially with my
spiritual orientation. i'd be willing to date someone who isn't
veg, but it is an obvious plus if you are vegetarian.<br />
the same goes for drinking. i don't drink because i don't like the
effect it has on me -- there isn't any big thing that happens, i
just don't want to be intoxicated. i'd be willing to date someone
who does drink some, and i don't necessarily mind being around
people who are drinking. but if you're a big drinker things are not
likely to work.","you like what you've read here, think we might connect and are
local.","white",69,80000,"computer / hardware / software","2012-06-30-13-52","alameda, california","","straight","","other and very serious about it","m","cancer and it&rsquo;s fun to think about","no","english (fluently)","single"

thanks for taking a read. i am an outgoing, confident guy. i am
well-traveled in europe and the states, yet to travel so far west
that it turns to the far east...so far. interesting as the world is
""there's no place like home!"" - i love the bay area! i respect and
enjoy multi-cultures (the only ""type"" of person i do not prefer
is... a xenophobe.) i am very personable, yet selective
romantically. i am not looking for add-water-and-stir ""instant
intimacy"". intelligent and clever, dry-witted humor cracks me up!
watching some sports, sometimes, is a kick, but i am not a fanatic
(no 49er's face painting here!) i have solid faith and respect al
those with and without faith. i am no bible-thumper, and frankly
""find"" god-snobs ""lost"". hiking for scenery and a good reading spot
is a sweet pleasure. i like pretty much anything outdoors;
although, i'm not a davie crocket type with a holstered deer knife
strapped to my belt. creative is fun for me. chess is a great play,
sometimes, and so is mixing-it-up on any gameboard, sometimes. of
course, everybody enjoys a good flick, now and then. i am
well-mannered, chivalrous-enough without being goofy about it (i
open doors, but have yet to throw an overcoat across a puddle. i am
not a doormat.) i appreciate a sincere woman that enjoys
""experiencing"" life and enjoys making memories. dining to merely
swap stories is not my interest. let's checkout that cafe with the
acoustic guitarist. and then there's the open air concert, too.
ormaybe layin' low with the comforts of home. food? i like it all!
although i cook well-enough, my presentation skills do exceed my
culinary capabilities. point being, i like to live life and with
variety. by nature, i have a smile easily shared. education
includes a mba. i absolutely looove being a father, teacher, coach,
mentor, role model to my precocious thirteen-year-old son (now
taller than me with size 13 feet!) we have a solid, loving

i was born in south africa and my parents decided to immigrate to
america at the age of ten. we moved to salt lake city where we
settled for ten years. my parents found it difficult to ultimately
settle and moved back to south africa. one of my brothers and i
tried to move back. however, after a few years i decided that i
would rather live on this side of the planet for now. so
immigration has played a huge role in my life, and has largely
shaped me as a person. another big thing is that i was raised in a
mormon family, however during my teenage years i decided it wasn't
the right course for me and rebelled hardcore. i've been
artistically inclined my entire life, and today i find myself
making videos and working in the film industry to make a
living.<br />

were gallant and woman were feisty, in the style of frank capra,
billy wilder ""the apartment"" is my favorite movie of all time ),
howard hawks, alfred hitchcock and not to perpetuate a female
cliche but i love audrey hepburn movies. sadly they just don't make
movies like they used to anymore. others: godard's anna karina
films, fellini's guilietta masina films, pickpocket, au hasard
balthazar, les adventures des antoine doinel, diabolique, cria
cuervos, black orpheus, czech new wave such as loves of a blonde

times i watch eagle vs.shark, it never ceases to be any less
side-splitting than it was the first time that i saw it.<br />

bourdain: no reservations, modern family, friday night lights, 30

arrested development, portlandia (it's a must after living in the

stevens, van morrison . . . my formative years were rooted in punk
(garage/post/brit/hardcore), glam, college radio, lo-fi indie, and
riot grrrl. i actually still have the very first mixed tape ever
made for me in jr. high by a boy. it was my introduction to it all
and it was legendary; and even though the boy was only puppy love,
that tape set the bar for all those to come. of course, after more
than two decades it finally fell on its last leg. but i gave it
proper burial and i've painstakingly recreated a digital copy of
the entire playlist so that it can live forever, reincarnated in

-<br />
other than ""i am me"" - but i will try.<br />
<br />
i love to tell jokes, making people laugh and smile, i believe
a<br />
day without laughter is a day wasted (as is a day without learning
something new). i enjoy riding my bike and trying new experiences,
especially if it is food related.<br />
<br />
<strong>update:</strong> my current new experience is swing
dancing. i've been attending the sunday morning lindy hop in the
park. it is a lot of fun and a good work out.","i am currently on my way to getting my master's degree in physics.
in the mean time, i am working as a teaching assistant and i am
doing some simulations research with a professor.<br />
<br />
i bike every day, trying to go from ""average"" to thin/buff.<br />
i am also, as always, looking for new things to learn, new music to
listen to, new foods to try... over all just trying to
experience<br />
new things in this world and live life to its fullest.","taking it easy and making people smile.<br />
also not to sound trite i'm a good listener.","the first thing is definitely my laugh - i just enjoy life,<br />
even when it's been getting me down. i always find a way to laugh.
when something strikes me as funny, or i'm just in a good mood, i
let out a strong laugh. i hold nothing back.<br />
<br />
the second thing people notice about me is my hair. i have a<br />
long hair braid. people call it a jedi braid or a rat tail...but
it<br />
is neither. i usually call it a que or a pony tail and it is based
off<br />
of a character from the sci-fi show earth final conflict
(created<br />
by gene roddenberry).<br />
<br />
the last thing people seem to notice about me - and it's<br />
something i love about myself - is my eyes. they change color from
day to day. some days they look blue, others gray or even green.","<strong>books:</strong> i like sci-fi and fantasy mostly. though i
do enjoy a good realistic fiction or mystery too.<br />
my favorite books are: wheel of time series, chronicles of narnia
(not ashamed to admit it), flatlander,neuromancer, pattern
recognition, lord of the rings, xanth, timeline<br />
<br />
<strong>movies:</strong> i love movies, but they need to be
entertaining. i am not a big fan of horror or scary movies, but
there are a few that i will enjoy.<br />
my favorite movies are: back to the future, aliens, armageddon, die
hard, willow, time bandits, serenity, pulp fiction, fargo, the
simpsons movie, highlander<br />
<br />
<strong>music:</strong> i love music. i'm definitely a classic rock
and oldies kind of guy, but i like artists and songs from pretty
much every genre - from hip-hop to metal.<br />
<br />
<strong>food:</strong> yes.<br />
<br />
i could keep going on listing things i like, but i am pretty sure
you get the idea by now. i needs things to be fun and actiony with
a hint of comedy. the stuff i like can't take it self too
seriously, but it also can't be mindless.","my family &amp; friends<br />

science and food. food keeps me sustained and science keeps me
entertained. this is probably why i like to bake - it's science for
hungry people.<br />
<br />
i also spend a lot of time thinking about philosophy and sociology.

everything ties together.","","","","white",74,20000,"student","2012-06-08-22-11","san francisco, california","","straight","likes cats","agnosticism but not too serious about it","m","cancer and it&rsquo;s fun to think about","no","english (fluently)","single"

<br />
my friend tells me i'm an infp and that is unusual. i wouldn't
disagree that i'm unusual.<br />
<br />
research reveals that infps present a calm, pleasant face to the
world. they appear to be tranquil and peaceful to others, with
simple desires. in fact, the infp internally feels his or her life
intensely. in the relationship arena, this causes them to have a
very deep capacity for love and caring which is not frequently
found with such intensity in the other types. the infp does not
devote their intense feelings towards just anyone, and are
relatively reserved about expressing their inner-most feelings.
they reserve their deepest love and caring for a select few who are
closest to them. infps are generally laid-back, supportive and
nurturing in their close relationships. with introverted feeling
dominating their personality, they're very sensitive and in-tune
with people's feelings, and feel genuine concern and caring for
others. slow to trust others and cautious in the beginning of a
relationship, an infp will be fiercely loyal once they are
committed. with their strong inner core of values, they are intense
individuals who value depth and authenticity in their
relationships.<br />
<br />
warmly concerned and caring towards others sensitive and perceptive
about what others are feeling. loyal and committed - they want
lifelong relationships. deep capacity for love and caring. driven
to meet other's needs. strive for ""win-win"" situations. nurturing,
supportive and encouraging. likely to recognize and appreciate
other's need for space. able to express themselves well.<br />
<br />
infps feels tremendous loyalty and commitment to their
relationships. with the feeling preference dominating their
personality, harmony and warm feelings are central to the infp's
being. they feel a need to be in a committed, loving
relationship.<br />
<br />
sexually, the infp is likely to be initially slow to open up to
their mates. once their trust has been earned, the infp will view
sexual intimacy as an opportunity for expressing their deep-seated
love and affection. more than the actual sexual act, they will
value giving and receiving love and sweet words. (well. ok. but i'm
a guy; ;-)<br />
<br />
infps are very aware of their own space, and the space of others.
they value their personal space, and the freedom to do their own
thing. they will cherish the mate who sees the infp for who they
are, and respects their unique style and perspectives. the infp is
not likely to be overly jealous or possessive, and is likely to
respect their mate's privacy and independence. in fact, the infp is
likely to not only respect their mate's perspectives and goals, but
to support them with loyal firmness.<br />
<br />
in general, infps are warmly affirming and loving partners who make
the health of their relationships central in their lives. although
cautious in the beginning, they become firmly loyal to their
committed relationships, which are likely to last a lifetime. they
take their relationships very seriously, and will put forth a great
deal of effort into making them work.<br />
<br />
infps highly value authenticity and depth in their personal
relationships.","making the world suck a little bit less, or trying to. although

37,"athletic","","socially","never","graduated from masters program","i'm online for the same reasons that many of you are too - to find
someone compatible, interesting and fun - for friends and
more.<br />
<br />
it's hard to find good guys walking on the street, so one has to be
open to the possibilities of the online world. i have checked out
okc for a bit and while i've made a few friends i'm not overly
optimistic of finding a keeper here :-)<br />
<br />
i am sane, sexy, and smart<br />
<br />
since, very surprisingly, there's no section devoted to the kind of
person i'm looking for i'll include here. there are 7 things i look
for in someone that will be more than a friend. in order, 1.
physical attraction &amp; chemistry, 2. mental stability, 3.
affection, 4. loyalty, 5. romance 6. kindness &amp; empathy, 7.
healthy sex drive. these 7 things have fundamentally remained
unchanged from the time i asked myself - what am i looking for in a
guy. they are all important for the ""complete package deal"". i
present the order only so people can see relative importance to me.
while not explicit, i'd expect someone i'm attracted to would have
at least average intelligence :-)","i lead a busy life with work and related travel, and spending time
with family &amp; friends. i treasure family vacations and
weekends. while always time-constrained i try to plan ahead to do
the things that matter - impulsive on the weekends, but fairly
meticulous during the week.<br />
<br />
i also find time for community service. my interests are
particularly around disadvantaged people or discriminated groups.
in particular, causes that i tend to support are: hunger, abused
women and children, cancer, civil rights. it's by no means an
inclusive list.","taking care of the people i love. of course, like most type a
personalities i may be rough on people at times, but the fact i
care about people is never in question.<br />
<br />
thinking incisively, being objective, and being decisive - it's
what i do at work and there's a natural spill-over into my personal
life. it doesn't mean that i can't let loose and be adventurous
outside of work. it's almost like being two people - conservative
and predictable at work; adventurous yet dependable at home.<br />
<br />
i have a very analytical mind and often tend to look at things
initially as black &amp; white, and then bring in the shades of
gray. put another way, i tend to think with my head first, and then
check with my heart :-)","that i'm not white, and i don't mean that in a bad way :-)<br />
once they get over that it's my smile and eyes.","books - a variety of business books and law books. i like many of
peter drucker's books. i think he's the greatest management thinker
in modern times. i have an unusual interest in constitutional law
and have spent time teaching myself, and follow major supreme court
cases. i try to read the briefs ahead of time and come to my own
rulings and compare them to scotus rulings eventually.<br />
<br />
movies - mostly action movies (court room dramas, murder mysteries,
suspense thrillers), but also like some comedies, romantic flicks,
and socially thought provoking movies (e.g., a time to kill,
philadelphia).<br />
<br />
music - anything that sounds good on the ear is good for me! not a
big fan of loud, blaring music at the clubs though.<br />
<br />
food - too many - indian, italian, mexican, middle eastern, afghan,
thai, greek, and good old american. i selectively like chinese at
nice places, not carte blanche.","the basics: food, clothing, shelter :-)<br />
family &amp; friends<br />
freedom<br />
internet","life, freedom, social justice &amp; equity, role of government,
role of the supreme court.<br />
constantly improving the quality of my business thinking and work
to improve corporate america.<br />
constant self-improvement - i'm as human as the next person, but
how do i get better than i was yesterday - cut down my flaws and
increase my strengths.<br />
occasionally i think about love - the ultimate love would be to
find someone i could love as much as he'd love me, and someone i
would do anything for. i wonder, of course, if that's realistic, or
just the stuff fairy tales are made of :-)<br />
i'm looking for someone perfect for me, however imperfect he may
be.","doing any of a host of things - if it's been a long week i may end
up going to bed early evening and then waking up at 1 am for the
rest of the night, going out to dinner with friends, watching a
movie (sometimes at the theater, but mostly at home), attending
social events, being at a coffee bar, etc. i don't know if there's
a typical friday. every friday is different.","*this section intentionally left blank*","you are looking for (1) a friend to hang with, (2) an activity
partner to do things with, (3) a good guy to go out on a date and
see if there's something more there.<br />
i am only looking for sincere guys - ideally to date, but a handful
of friends is ok. i don't have high expectations online here but
still believe in pleasant surprises once in a while.","indian",68,-1,"executive / management","2012-06-30-17-35","san francisco, california","","gay","likes dogs","","m","","no","english","single"

women and queers. and female gansta rap from the 1990s such h.w.a.,

i've been an organizer and activist most of my life, grounded in
movements for social, racial, economic, and environmental
justice.<br />
<br />
my other love is photography and i almost always have my nikon in
hand. i do mostly documentary photography of the communities,
struggles, and protests that are important to me.<br />
<br />
i believe in fighting hard and playing hard. when i'm not
organizing, i'm out hiking a trail with my dog, biking up tunnel rd
with my friends, hitting the climbing gym, running the lake under

but here are some of my recent faves in each category:<br />
<br />
<strong>books:</strong> books are among my favorite things in life!
i read a combination of nerdy labor history and movement strategy,
and some occasional fiction. i'm trying to read more books in
spanish. in dubious battle, the immortal life of henrietta lacks,
little bee, zeitoun, why david sometimes wins, restoring the power
of unions, union of their dreams, ms alla de mi, casas de carton,
the lacuna, playbook for progressives, solidarity divided. oh and
the hunger games!!<br />
<br />
<strong>movies:</strong> i adore documentaries, and watch alot of
movies in spanish. tambien la lluvia, los invisibles, princesas,
salt of the earth.<br />
<br />
<strong>shows:</strong> i don't own a tv. and i like it like that.
though i sometimes catch a peak at the daily show or the colbert
report on my laptop.<br />
<br />
<strong>music:</strong> mostly underground, political hip hop and
some spanish rock. ana tijoux, bocafloja, the coup, dead prez,
immortal technique, thievery corporation, los rakas, manu chao,
orishas, ozomatli, rebel diaz.<br />
<br />
<strong>food:</strong> anything vegan. but my favorites are
avocados, sweet potatoes, black beans, kale, strawberries,
blueberries, dark chocolate, siracha, green tea, and red wine. so
many good places around oakland to get vegan sushi, bbq pulled
""pork,"" carmelized ""chicken,"" vegan soul food, vegan notta-ricotta
pizza, vegan donuts and cinnabuns. love all the oakland farmers
markets, esp. the bolani samples.","life has been a process of learning to live without the people and
things i'd previously thought i could never do without, but:<br />
<br />
1. organizing - a good march, sit in, civil disobedience.<br />
2. my doggie - an adorable boxer pitbull mix named paisley.<br />
3. my crew - mi familia y mis compaeros for life.<br />
4. photography - specifically, my nikon d90 and aperture.<br />
5. nature - to be out in the sunshine, wind, stars.<br />
6. endorphins - biking, running, climbing, self-defense, sex.","","not sure about typical, but my last few fridays consisted of:<br />
* tamarind margaritas for a friend's birthday<br />
* vegan soul food with my crew<br />
* greyhounds and mj brass boppers show at van kleef's<br />
* watching project bandaloop on the great wall of oakland<br />
* political debates around a backyard firepit<br />
* fundraiser for a rad movement organization","let's talk about this in person, shall we?","at this point in life, i know what i want - a compaero(a) to
(eventually) really throw down with, be best friends with, build a

it only really works to partner up with folks for whom social
justice is a central part of their life.<br />

35,"average","strictly anything","socially","never","graduated from college/university","kudos to the strong women out there. women have this impossible
image to uphold. in this world where image is everything, you're in
an impossible balance between what people say you should do and
what you want to do. what i mean by that is, women like sex just as
much as men do, maybe even more, but society values women based on
how small the number of men they were with and the ""virtuous"" type
of sex they had with them. women do their best between a rock and a
hard place (no pun intended) and i salute you.<br />
<br />
i understand your situation, but there are men who love women who
can be freakish and appreciate their true nature; and not make them
""locker room talk."" there are men who don't believe in the double
standard. i'm all about women fucking who they want to fuck and as
many as they want and however they want to fuck them without guilt
or judgment.<br />
<br />
ok, i know it's scary. there are lots of men out there who make
things really difficult. so, i have compiled some of things i'll do
with you:<br />
<br />
1. communication is key. tell me what you like or don't like. i
tend push boundaries sometimes. if it makes you uncomfortable, just
say so and i'll pull back. a woman's assertiveness is a turn on and
i'm up for the give and take.<br />
<br />
2. i realize every woman is different and what they like is unique
to each individual. therefore, i'm going to ask what you like. if i
wiggle my fingers around your clit like i'm trying to tickle you or
i drum your fingertips against your vulva like i'm impatiently
waiting at the sears tire center for my receipt or i push the clit
like it's a doorbell at some house that i need to get inside of,
tell me! i'll comply with what you like.<br />
<br />
3. i'm upfront and straightforward with my intentions and desires.
speaking of honesty, i'm not looking for for anything serious from
the beginning. all my relationships start casual and develop into
something serious if we both like each other. in other words,
friends with benefits first, then if we both decide to get into a
relationship, that'll be fine.<br />
<br />
4. i'm into free-spirited women who have no hang-ups about being a
sexual being. i don't judge women based on how much or what kind of
sex they had with how many men. i'd treat a virgin the same way i
would a porn star. actually, i'd treat the porn star better because
she doesn't buy into what people say she should be, which makes for
unhappy people anyways.<br />
<br />
5. i don't like condoms, but they will be used! i never heard of
any man or woman who said they actually liked condoms. those things
hurt as much as they hurt you, but i don't want you to become a
pregger, and i don't want to catch anything? communication about
how to sex better (again, #2) is important.<br />
<br />
6. i really like it when you cum! seeing you in ecstasy is one of
the most gratifying things ever! seeing you quiver and shake makes
me want to fuck you even harder. however, it takes time to learn
your body. help me expedite the process by telling me how you like
it. if you don't know, we'll explore together. i like to explore
your body as much you like to explore yours.<br />
<br />
7. i love foreplay!!!...and i hope you do as much as i do. the more
you take care of your body, the more i'll reward your hard work
with sensual and light touching with my fingertips, lips, and
mouth. physically, i desire a woman with pleasing curves who is
either slim, or full figured. i am not a man that is into huge
women. (don't take it personally).<br />
<br />
oh yeah, no jealous women please, as i'm not either (gees, i can be
a swinger).<br />

old stuff ...<br />
<br />
oh my, how do you go about describing yourself?<br />
<br />
i always fell that this part is like a preview for a movie... you
can babble for ages and it still has nothing to do with what the
movie is all about.<br />
<br />
here are a few random things i (think that i) know about
myself:<br />
<br />
- i'm funny and goofy but not the class clown<br />
- i'm responsible and careful but at the same time adventurous and
will take calculated risks (btw, if they are calculated, are they
still risks?)<br />
- i look and feel younger than i am<br />
- i love to run but i'm recovering from over use injury so now i
swim more and run less. turns out i love to swim laps too,
yay!<br />
- i haven't had a boss since 1996 - update: i now have a boss :-(
but i'll survive<br />
- i am a photographer, it is not only my job, it is what and who i
am, it is my passion and you will have to take my camera from my
cold, dead hands ;-)<br />
- i grew up by the sea and can't live too far from nature or a
large body of water (a lake might do for a while but sooner than
later i will need an ocean or at least a sea)<br />
- i need to know what is on the other side of the hill... curiosity
killed the cat<br />
- i used to travel a lot for my work and have been to antarctica
three times... now i take real vacations where i actually get some
r&amp;r.<br />
- i'm loyal and have strong morals<br />
- i'm more of a cat person than a dog person even though i had both
as a kid (plus a few fish, rabbits, turtles and birds), right now
it's all irrelevant as my lease does not allow pets<br />
- i'm more the rolling stones than the beatles<br />
- traveling west... i've realized i've been doing it all my life
and i have slowly made my way across two continents and an
ocean<br />
- i think animals with ringed tails and black and white birds are
cute and funny<br />
- i have a red epiphone sg electric guitar, her name is rosie but
all i know are three chords and a scale<br />
- i name my cars, cameras and guitars - girl names<br />
- i swear like a pirate but can keep it under control around our
bosses, your parents and children<br />
- right now i'm an intj<br />
- and most importantly, i know and like who i am :-)","i sold my soul to the brand and creative department of a large it
company last year but my mind still roams free amongst clouds,
waves, trees and mountains... 24/7... my body does too but only on
weekends and vacations.","mad skills: with a camera, in the kitchen, underwater","my very confusing english accent... mix one part english, one part
spanish, shake (don't stir) and let it loose in the us for 6 years

sound like myself but then, i have been hearing myself babble all
my life and must be used to it","<strong>books</strong> i read, lots, what ever i can get my hands

to and why. i liked that question so i will use the description of
the english setter to describe me:<br />
<br />
this breed's standard temperament is best described as a ""gentleman
by nature."" however, it can also be strong-willed and mischievous.
english setters are energetic, people-oriented dogs, that are well
suited to families who can give them attention and activity, or to
working with a hunter, where they have a job to do. they are active
dogs outside that need plenty of exercise in a good sized fenced-in
yard. inside they tend to be lower energy and love to be couch
potatoes and lap dogs that love to cuddle. they are good around
children.<br />
english setters are very intelligent and can be trained to perform
about any task another breed can do, with the exception of herding.
however, they are not always easy to train, as their natural bird
instinct tends to distract them in outdoor environments. their
temperament is considered a soft one. therefore they are very
sensitive to criticism, and could be unwilling to repeat a
behaviour out of fear to disappoint the trainer. positive
reinforcement training methods therefore work best for english
setters.<br />
<br />
i had english setters for years. their behaviors' rubbed off on
me.<br />
<br />
what i am looking for?<br />

i like to consider myself a very creative type. i am the type of

and hold a strong conviction for improving the world around me. i
deeply enjoy social gatherings, meeting new people and developing
new personal connections.<br />

and am therefore one my harshest critics, while simultaneously
serving as a cheerleader for those around me.<br />
<br />
being on my own, has definitely served as a wake up call to my own
self-worth. i am more aware of what i bring to the table, and am
slowly beginning to develop the ""cahones"" to serve as my own
advocate for my well-being. i like to think that i am in a constant
state of metamorphosis, changing and adapting my needs, wants,
talents, emotions to the new situations that i encounter. as i
mature, i am however holding firmly to those people and those
beliefs that have really come to shape the person i have become in
my brief 23 years.","i'm a currently working as a 6th grade math and science teacher

books: i wish kayo books on post street was open all the time. when
i can't hang around there reading pulp and back issues of mad

brain. i started the confidence man by herman melville and really
liked it, but i left my copy back east and need to get another one.
i tried to read madame bovary but then i was totally derailed by a
happy days marathon from a season without richie, ralph
malf...shit, even chachi was hardly in it. i rebounded by reading
nobody move by denis johnson. then the little foxes by lillian
hellman, you don't love me yet by jonathan lethem, ask the dust by
john fante, and hotel california by barney hoskyns, which is all
about the eagles and joni mitchell and jackson browne and mounds
and mounds of blow. now i'm reading the memoir of former soul
coughing front man mike doughty, which is pretty interesting even
though every single person in it is obnoxious and i didn't even
really like soul coughing all that much. on deck are mr. nice by
howard marks, black monk time by eddie shaw, john ashbery's new
translation of illuminations...and madame bovary and the confidence
man.<br />
<br />
music: music is the most important thing in the world to me. i like
vinyl, although i've been separated from my collection here. the
recent pile, representative of my tastes only by being random,
includes shuggie otis, cutty ranks, green on red, norman blake,
mickey newbury and various other early-70s singer-songwriters (who
the hell is tom ghent? ron nagle? dennis linde? dennis linde is
awesome, that's who dennis linde is), the new feelies, eddie
kendricks, ann peebles, dolorean, andy bey, soft machine, modern

hotel lights, pete rock &amp; c.l. smooth. furthermore, it seems i
had long been underestimating quadrophenia.<br />

tap-dance finale on a gigantic typewriter. it was outstanding. (i
also like typewriters.)<br />

better at visualizing what i feel like eating, and then figuring

i am kind of a mish-mosh of things. you can find me dressed up at
the opera or country club, just as much as drumming and dancing in
the woods around a fire. i can be professional or hippy. i think
this comes from being curious about the world around me and liking
to try new things. i'm handy and can fix things myself (or at least
know how to figure it out), i have a bit of ""geek"" in me as well as

i believe strongly in high integrity and clear communication. i
have a bit of new yorker in me, so i usually say things like they
are and would rather be clear and have it out than avoid matters or

<br />
i am a mix of alternative and traditional, polite and crazy. (kinda
like swirled fro-yo.) i've been in ca my whole life, more or liess.
been in the bay area about 20 years. i am quite happy here.<br />
<br />
i like laughing a lot, pretty silly - big fan of the world of tina
fey, maya rudolph, et al. i think 30 rock is genius.<br />
<br />
i also really like talking about society and people and trying to
figure out this crazy world. when i watch sports or out in the
world, i'm usually more interested in that bizarre thing that
happened over there, than where the ball is. but i do love
baseball, frisbee, volleyball, riding my bike....<br />
<br />
i have a large community and have a great life that i am pretty
content with, but here to meet men who i haven't met already.<br />
i am not so into the concept of online dating, but i'm home a lot
these days, and much more selective about going out, so i feel like
i just need to meet more people than i can naturally, by being in
my apartment by myself. being that, um, there is no one else
here.<br />
<br />
right now, i am looking for either someone to play with and go to
parties with; or someone to chill in oakland with - watch movies,

23,"thin","","socially","never","graduated from college/university","i work in the theatre with a bunch of weird people, and have come
to expect a certain quota of weirdness in my life. my career is
really important to me, it's where i feel at home, and where i find
my family. i'm far too mature and responsible for my own good. but
when i'm tired of being that i become something else entirely
(we're talking speaking with inanimate objects, giggling like an
imbecile over anything, making friends with insects, you know a
normal tuesday). i don't do anything half-way, and i don't much
care for societal expectations, but i don't wear that on my sleeve
or in my hair (wait, does having half of a mohawk count as wearing
it in your hair? if it does then i may have to update this
statement...]. as careful and measured as i am, when i feel
strongly about something there is not enough better judgment in the
world that could stop me. i believe very strongly that adults have
fallen behind in the art of the sleepover (the non-sexual kind),
and that the magic of sleep deprivation and soul-baring
conversations never loses it power. probably why i do
theatre...which is kind of like a giant stressful sleepover...that
lasts for weeks and creates art. the ability to continually learn
and grow is one of the most important things to me.<br />
<br />
i don't get embarrassed; i'm ridiculously secure in who i am, or
just really fucking stubborn, depending on how you want to see it.
i'm partial to commas, but i'll give it all up for a good
semi-colon. i curse like a sailor, and make everything into a dirty
joke: especially at work. accommodation should be my middle name;
but if you tell me what to do, i'll probably do the opposite. i am
of non-binary gender [some folks might say gender-variant,
genderqueer, or something to that effect.] honestly, i don't have a
label; i'm just not female, but i'm quite happy with my self and my
body as they are. i can be too nice for my own good, but i'm
getting better. i absolutely love my life and prefer to be around
people who feel the same.<br />
<br />
i am intelligent, passionate, and silly.","i'm in love with working in theatre, and i have been for some time
now; it is incurable and exhilarating. often, i leave work with a
goofy grin on my face, and a warm fuzzy feeling inside.<br />
<br />
at work i am a professional stage manager; it allows me to be a
part of producing art, even though i am not an artist myself. i
love being around artists, and i love putting order to things. i'll
never know what it is exactly that makes me so in love with
theatre, but then again i find that the best things in my life are
usually the un-explained.<br />
<br />
i get asked a lot what a stage manager does, and alas i have found
that there is no easy answer to this question. but i can say, there
aren't very many people who desire my job, and people who are good
at it are hard to find. [i've never thought it was coincidental
that stage manager is shortened to s &amp; m.] the truth is, i do
my job purely for the glamour...you know those moments where i can
take out the illustrious garbage, mop the fantastical floor, and
for the privilege of smelling other's dirty laundry...there's just
nothing else like it! current glamorous activities include:
spraying and shoveling dirt, watering plants, lots of vacuuming,
mixing clay to the perfect consistency, and putting in hair
extensions.<br />
<br />
also, unofficially educating people on gender and sexuality.
something i study furiously in my 'free time' (ha!) and care about
deeply. i think about going back to school and getting my ma in
sexuality studies, and pursuing that also. because one useless,
completely unemployable major just wasn't enough for me, i needed
two! because that's just the kind of over-achiever i am.","self deprecation and being awesome.<br />

little weirdness are the things people generally see in me. i used
to be described as aloof and stand-offish - now i'm often told that
i am social and friendly (personal growth!).<br />
apparently i look like a vegetarian lesbian (although this seems to
be increasing in strength, people are starting to think i'm vegan).
i eat meat and date guys though. but people have been assuming this
since i was 12, so apparently thats what i look like.","books: generally either really fucked-up off the wall fiction, or
gender and sexuality studies:<br />
american psycho. bonk. brave new world. death with interruptions.
dude, you're a fag. glamorama. hos, hookers, call girls and rent
boys. lunar park. one day. she's not there. sound and the fury.

hedwig and the angry inch. manic. the piano teacher. scott pilgrim
vs. the world. shortbus. most good documentaries.<br />
<br />
i love to cook, and i compulsively feed the people in my life. for
me, nothing beats cooking for friends and sharing bottles of wine
and talking into the night. my obsession with anything ginger is
totally unparalleled. tomatoes make up a very large portion of my
diet. and i couldn't live without pasta. squash, black beans, and
peppers of all kinds make me giddy (serranos are my personal
favorite).","1. running shoes<br />

night, where you end up revealing way too much]","work, and finding more work. because unless i think about myself as
constantly unemployed, i most likely will be.<br />
<br />
gender, sexuality, and the like. why some people are convinced that
i'm female, and others swear i'm male, and what causes the
difference. and even why i need to be either.<br />
<br />
i'm a very people-focused person; a lot of my energy is concerned
with the people i work with and care about. i like connecting with
people and observing them.<br />
<br />
why it is that the shins sound so awesome in the morning, and abbey
road is perfect for sunny afternoons, and sex and ice cream are
always more satisfying in the afternoon.","this premise is rather 9-5normative, isn't it? i'll be working,
probably, because friday is one of those days i am most likely to
be working.<br />
<br />
my time off is more irregular, so i get my free time activities in
throughout the week, and whenever they arrive.","i have more public displays of emotions while riding bart late at

probably can't be friends.)<br />
<br />
passion and ambition are always sexy. self-esteem is a must. if you
like to talk, and you like to learn.<br />

through my set of consecutive moves to more urban places, i have
definitely shifted in mindset and have turned from a rural country
boy into more of a city boy. i really like to take advantage of
what san francisco and the greater bay area and west coast have to
offer and some of my favorite things to do include: random
neighborhood exploration/walking tours, hanging out in the
tenderloin/going to hooker's sweet treats, camping along the coast,
reading, people watching, or doing work in coffeeshops (haus or
north beach anyone...and my ultimate favorite in bauhaus in
seattle), going to festivals/parades, or going on a nice early
saturday hike. i have experienced a number of these great things by
myself and with friends and always love meeting new
friends/potential boyfriends who are interested in some of the same
experiences.<br />
<br />

within the next couple of years. also trying to maintain a strong
focus on overall wellness and health and continuing to grow as a
person.","- finding fun, random, and unique things to do in san francisco. i
get bored easily-ish so that lends itself to constant
exploration.<br />
- being a productive morning person.<br />
- 1-1 interaction and listening to other people.<br />
- remembering things.<br />
- breaking out of the castro mold and exploring the neighborhoods
of sf (favorites are the tenderloin, north beach, russian hill, and
the marina) and parts of greater bay area. encouraging my friends
to do the same.<br />
- being an expert on sf history. i can't go on enough sf city
guides (http://sfcityguides.org/) walking tours.<br />
- recommending good iphone apps to people.","usually my glasses, which made me ""nerdy"" (not a look that i
usually go for ;p ) or that i am skinny.","books - anything loaded on my iphone instapaper or
self-improvement.<br />
<br />
movies - i am not much of a sitting still type of person, but i
always enjoy the home alone movies or little miss sunshine.<br />
<br />
shows - i don't have a tv so don't really keep up with a ton. i
mostly get into stuff that i grew up with like full house or saved
by the bell.<br />
<br />
music - current favorites are lana del rey, crystal castles, mgmt,
keane, and madonna.<br />
<br />
food - korean, sushi, german, italian and mexican.","1. alone time for reflection/recuperating. i am definitely an
introvert.<br />
2. solid 1-1 friendships. my best friendships tend to be 1-1 and i
really like doing just the day-to-day things like grocery shopping,
going on a walk, or getting coffee and chatting with a good

3. rainy days. i'll take the comfort of one over a sunny day
anytime. also like the fog :).<br />
4. outdoors. as much as i love being a part of the city, i can't
get enough hiking, mountains, green trees, and campfires.<br />

possibilities: dinner, happy hour, dancing, camping/weekend trip, a
relaxing night in (never a bad thing - i definitely have somewhat
of a homebody drive), going to a show, going for a walk, having
friends over/going over to friends.","let me save a few things for if we meet :).","- my profile caught your eye and you have something more to say
than ""hi"" - hi is nice but it is always great to hear why you
messaged me if you do.<br />
- you have time to dedicate to meeting a new person, but at same
time value you own friendships/involvements that you want to
maintain and balance.<br />
- you are minimal on expectations and are free enough to hang out a
few times to see if we are a good match (i normally don't have
everything decided by end of first date/time meeting) - open to
friends and dating both is cool.<br />

you.<br />
<br />
you're a man comfortable in his own skin, who operates from a place
of authenticity acts get old, but you are more interesting than any
facade. you're adaptable and flexible yet apply a strong sense of
integrity to your interpersonal relationships. you understand that
communication is key to mutual understanding and hang in there even
when there is conflict. you've got your life together but aren't
afraid to make some shifts for the right person. you're open to the
possibility of a relationship (note: if you are looking for
something not in the context of relationship i think the search
tools on this site can help you locate that. it isn't here.)<br />
<br />
you're emotionally mature but youthful in outlook....dancing,
music, painting, cooking...you enjoy your creative outlets. you're
curious about the world, able to entertain lots of ideas,
cosmologies and theories without needing to proselytize - most
people walk around with their minds all made up....but for you, on
some issues the jury is still out.<br />
<br />
you consider yourself intelligent, educated, respectful,
considerate of others' feelings, a man with good boundaries who can
articulate what they are.<br />
<br />
you know how to have fun, laugh and step out a little beyond your
comfort zone in the spirit of adventure. you're a great
storyteller, love entertaining and being entertained.<br />
<br />
you are resolved with your past. you won't spend our first date (or
first few dates) telling me all about your ex wife, her vocation,
favorite cuisine etc. (yes, that should seem obvious but you'd be
surprised.) we've all been there - but with you your ex is
emotional history and not a current event.<br />

have an appreciation for other cultures, languages, and

entire history on a first date. i try my best to be kind and
courteous to others (just because i have the right-of-way at a

bay area born and raised. i would say i'm well traveled especially

slanted. that being said i love to get off the beaten path and

enjoy the occasional social beer yet i'd probably have a better

it's not like you recite #include&lt;iostream&gt; int main() {
std::cout ""hello, my name is supergeek"" std::endl; } when meeting
people.) so all in all, i am pretty much normal when compared to
everyone else. talk to me about something i'm passionate about,
however, and watch me light up with geek written all over me.<br />
<br />
before i somehow turned into a geek, i was more of the artsy type.
i still sketch now and then and am thinking about painting again
when i find the time.<br />
<br />
before this year, i'd describe myself as someone who preferred to
stay indoors. lately, however, i've discovered that kayaking and
sailing are rather enjoyable. i had previously gone white water
rafting. i still have sky diving on my bucket list among other
things.<br />
<br />
lastly, i'm a big fat dork. i'd rather be appreciated for who i am
than how closely i resemble the stereotypical ""cool guy"". the last
thing i want to do is act like the guys who think they're
""god's-gift-to-women"". (please excuse me while i vomit at that
thought). and while i have no problems with babbling about
gibberish, i'd prefer to keep it to a minimum. it can be cute for a
while but it tends to lose its luster after overuse.<br />
<br />
i know i was supposed to keep this short but if you're not
half-asleep by now, feel free to ask me anything else you want to
know.","figuring out how to get from point a to point b in the grand scheme

i'm an engineer and i do enjoy my work but there's a huge gap
between what i currently am and what i had planned to be that needs
to be bridged.","- analyzing what went wrong and what should have been done

- getting my butt kicked in foosball by seasoned pros.<br />
- boring people. still reading this? thought so.","apparently i look really young. i get carded every single time and
i've been told my face hasn't changed one bit since i was 16.<br />
<br />
people also seem to have difficulty determining what ethnicity i
am. a couple of common questions/remarks:<br />
""are you half?"" <em>er, no, i'm 100% human, thank you very
much.</em><br />
""you're asian? you're barely asian!"" <em>uh, last i checked both my
parents were and i'm pretty sure i wasn't adopted so... (i
shouldn't have to spell that out for you).</em><br />
<br />
people also seem to be confused about which language to use when
talking to me.<br />
at one point some old white nun approached me and asked if i spoke
english. <em>uh... me no speak een-guh-rish sister. :-|</em><br />
i have also been frequently been spoken to in straight spanish.
<em>perdoneme, pero no hablo espanol. hables en ingles por
favor.</em>","favorite books: <em>the unbearable lightness of being</em>,
<em>dune</em>, <em>the count of monte cristo</em>,

the people you're interested in might go over your profile and

differently had you met them through other means. i think it's much
easier to build rapport in person since it's harder to imbue your
personality on a written profile. of course there are other issues
but i'm not about to turn this into an article analyzing the
downside of online dating.<br />

your personal growth after living like a peasant. i sort of hate
europeans now after two horrible experiences living with them. but
that's just mainland europeans. brits and the irish are still cool.
i also hate intellectual-types. like, shut the fuck up asshole. my
eight grade teacher told me ""everything you write is tinged with
cynicism."" i didn't know what cynicism was at the time. it's funny
now, though. i have a long history of being a snarky little brat
who hates on everything. i am very judgmental. i don't think you're
supposed to be this honest on a dating website. it's all for humor

critical and bitchy. and we laugh and laugh. i guess i'm just

as for movies, sitting still in a theater is not my favorite thing

that said, i do like going to the castro theater, especially for

great. pixar can usually hold my attention. hedwig and the angry
inch has been an important movie/musical in my life. 500 days of
summer. secretary. i love woody allen, especially annie hall. i

i believe that people's most basic needs should be taken care of
first, and that if we are to struggle to get anything in this
world, it should be our so-called luxuries. food, water, shelter,
health, companionship... these things are something we shouldn't
have to struggle for in a world where we've perfected farming, have
the technology to filter the dirtiest water, can build new
structures in a matter of weeks, and can collect data so rapidly
that our smart phones know more about us than we do.. these basic
needs shouldn't be struggles--no, they should be the nourishment
that motivates and innovates. i imagine a world where the only
thing left to 'want' are these so-called luxuries of life, not the
necessities of life.<br />
in different words:<br />
guests of my house don't need to ask about food, water, a place to
sleep, nor a friend--they're entitled to it here. (""sharing is
caring"") :)<br />
<br />
i really believe that absolutely nobody gets to where they are all
by themselves. sure, maybe a lot of the credit goes to you or your
immediate family.. and you may be inclined to think ""my family did
it all by themselves"", but you, nor they, nor i, would be where we
are (successful or not) without the influence of those around you.
appreciate everything that everyone does for you. that job
promotion you got, that was your peers/boss's decision. that date
you got on okcupid, someone made this site. that car you drive,
somebody built that. that tv show that makes you laugh so hard,
somebody wrote that. that tax loophole you used this year, someone
voted on that.. so, when you are enjoying something, there are many
many people to thank. you did not do it all by yourself,
sorry.<br />
<br />
i'm even more strange.<br />
i like to hear other people's stories.. you know, their life
stories; where they're from, why they do what they do, what they do
for fun, etc.. (part of the reason why i enjoy okc so much). so,
here's a little about me: (aka the self-summary before i added this
whole part as a preface :p)<br />
<br />
this is the coolest thing about my strangeness.<br />
i'm neither right-brained nor left-brained.. i love mathematics and
art equally, and quality and efficiency are both super important.
for proof of this, look at your favorite toys/tools/gadgets..<br />
<br />
i love trying new things. i think that's important to do.. to keep
your mind fresh. this past summer i took a pottery class, and i now
drink out of a coffee mug that i made. :)<br />
<br />
i think that being able to communicate well is very important. i am
not the greatest at it, and still get pretty nervous talking to
crowds, so right now i'm part of toastmasters, a club to help you
get better at public speaking.. and it's the most nervewrecking
thing i've ever done.<br />
<br />
numbers have always fascinated me. it's amazing how some things
just work (or do they 'just' work?) i love demystifying the
craziest things, like.. did you know that the sum of the first n
odd numbers adds up to nxn? try it.. i can make that piece of magic
seem like common sense if you want to talk about it (:<br />
<br />
being a math major introduced me to my current career path in life:
programming. i mostly write apps for the iphone/ipad but i'm trying
to get into web development too, and i still love my number hunting
algorithms and my genetic algorithms (i wrote a program in java
that generates music &gt;_&lt;)<br />
<br />
i love that i've moved around so much.. i feel much more cultured
than my average peer. i was born in brooklyn, raised in brooklyn,
queens and long island, (even spent a little bit of my childhood in
georgia and south carolina). i spent 2 years working at northern
kentucky university writing iphone apps, and now i just moved to
california for a new job (also writing iphone apps, except it's
cooler because it's not kentucky) -- (see, that's 4 states.. but
because of long island, it feels kind of like 5)","bettering myself. in every way.","problem solving.<br />

---<br />
<br />
so, it occurs to me that i really haven't changed my profile<br />
much since i first wrote it. since then, i've moved to the west
coast, been married, moved back to the east coast, been
divorced,<br />
made some awesome games, nearly died (more than once), picked up
some awesome skills, learned a lot, grew a lot, moved back to the
west coast (that's three cross-country moves, if you're counting),
and yet this profile seems to fit. i'll still sing stupid songs for
no reason. i still look angry when i don't mean to. i still make
games. i still do a mean connery. everything is different. and
everything's the same.<br />
<br />
so yeah, <a class=""ilink"" href=

actually, i tell stories and creates worlds for games. i get
paid<br />
for it and everything. if you pay attention to games, you've<br />
probably played something i've worked on.<br />
<br />
so what am i actually doing with my life? i don't really know,
but<br />
i like it that way. i mean, if i knew what i was doing, that
would<br />
take all the fun out of it, now wouldn't it? i do my best to
keep<br />
doing epic things. life is short; i'll be coming out of it
with<br />
some stories.","<a class=""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=dodging+questions"">dodging

good at not being impressed, but i don't think that's a
skill.<br />
that's not to say that i'm not excitable; i certainly get
excited<br />
about all sorts of things all the time every day.<br />
<br />
in the last few years, i've gotten really good at getting as
many<br />
places as possible on my bike. i've also gotten good at
making<br />
people say, ""you rode <em>how</em> far?""<br />
<br />
also, setting things on fire.","people usually say, ""why do you look so angry?"" i also hear ""i
have<br />
a friend who looks just like you."" i've gotten, ""hey, aren't
you<br />
that guy?"" a few times, but they rarely mean the guy that i<br />
actually am.<br />
<br />
people also tend to be surprised when they find out i'm a<br />
vegetarian (actually a pescatarian, but to most people they
mean<br />
the same thing). i guess i look like a carnivore.<br />
<br />
in general, i think that people misinterpret me based on how
i<br />
look. i think i look like a shaved headed thug to most people,
so<br />
they clutch their children and their material goods as i pass. if
i<br />
had to guess, i think most people would be surprised to learn
that<br />
i am intelligent, i babytalk at pets, i am a wealth of random<br />
knowledge, i'm pretty silly, and any one of a thousand things
that<br />
is apparently surprising if you take me at first glance.<br />
<br />
of course, you have to ask yourself, ""do i look like a
reasonable<br />
man, or a peppermint nightmare?""","you didn't read it, see it, hear it, or eat it. i'm cool.
that<br />
means i only like things that nobody knows about. if you did

so<br />
there. nyah.<br />
<br />
my tv is a movie and game monitor, and i keep track of the handful
of shows i like through the power of the internet.<br />
<br />
i don't like picking favorites. i don't do it with movies,
music,<br />
books, foods, comics, people, games, quotes, parties, clothes,
or<br />
anything else that people choose. i prefer groups of favorites.
i<br />
will say ""that's one of my favorite movies,"" and love all my<br />
favorite movies equally (but in different ways). i mean, how can
i<br />
say that i like apocalypse now more than i like star wars? the
two<br />
don't even compare. i mean, i don't even have a best friendi have
between 5-10 of them.<br />
<br />
for some of you, the burning question in your mind might be
""does<br />
this lack of favorites apply to romantic interests too?"" however,
the answer to that question is longer and more complicated than i'm
going to try to explain here, especially since this is suppose to
be about books or something.<br />

<br />
i think that the profile percentage is a trick to get me to
keep<br />
adding to my profile, but i'm not sure why. quantity without<br />
content is worthless. i mean, take this line. i'm only writing
this<br />
to see if the next percentage point demands that i add
another<br />
1,000 characters. are you learning anything about me right
now?<br />
maybe that i like to game the system? or that, if i feel like it,
i<br />
can write about anything until i get bored or distracted.
maybe<br />
you're learning that i can't really sleep without something<br />
covering me, even if it's just a sheet. though in all fairness,
you<br />
only learned that last one because i just came out and told
you.<br />
cheater.<br />
<br />
perhaps you could learn that i have seen every episode of <a class=
""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=the%3cbr+%2f%3e%0afacts+of+life"">the<br />
facts of life</a> ever produced. it's not something that i'm<br />
particularly proud of, but hey...it's certainly something. i
mean,<br />
have <em>you</em> seen all of them? are you sure? even the
ones<br />
after mrs. garrett remarried and joined the peace corps? i
mean,<br />
nobody really liked beverly anyway, so i understand if you
stopped<br />
watching after that point. the show almost lost it for me
when<br />
edna's edibles burned down and they replaced it with over our<br />
heads. i mean, that store was way too 80s retro for me and it
was<br />
1985 at the time. neon and glass block everywhere? c'mon.<br />
<br />
i did not see the 2001 made for tv movie reunion. perhaps i
should<br />
endevour to fill the only remaining hole in my facts of life<br />
experience.<br />
<br />
by the way, it did demand another 1,000 characters, so i'm
just<br />
going to keep talking about 80s tv shows. alf was another one.
i<br />
haven't seen all of <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=alf"">alf</a>, but i did see quite a bit. in
high<br />
school, we were supposed to write a speech about the most
important<br />
moment in our lives. most people wrote about their dog dying
or<br />
their grandmother dying. there was a lot of death. i,
however,<br />
wasn't about to stand in front of the class and expose my
personal<br />
life to the ridicule of backwoods pennsylvania mouth breathers.
i<br />
did my speech on the cancellation of alf.<br />
<br />
you see, alf was canceled in the middle of a two-part episode.
the<br />
government finally found alf and, in the last moments of the
last<br />
episode, they showed up at his door. to be continued. but no,
it<br />
was canceled. i got up in front of the class and told how
this<br />
moment taught me that there was no permanence in life. all
things<br />
ended, even alf. even when i was in the middle of an episode.<br />
<br />
i have also not seen the made for tv movie reunion of alf. it
would<br />
just cheapen the experience, i think. the fate of <a class=""ilink""

kind-hearted, an animal lover, usually cheerful, quietly
thoughtful, smart about his passions, and generally optimistic -
i'm kind of a female version of that.<br />
<br />
my vibe -<br />
i take each day as it comes, doing the best i can to be the best
person i can be at any given moment. i tend to live intensely - as
in, i seem to feel the emotions of everyday life quite vibrantly. i
laugh easily, i cry easily, i am honest, i sympathize well, i get
angry but can never hold a grudge...you get the idea. long ago i
wanted to study literature, and i think it's because i am drawn to
things that are poignant and profound. i am good at small talk in
those crowded party situations, but it's really the deeper
connections in life that i love to explore. i find some element of
beauty in almost everything. downtown oakland is beautiful to me
because everyday i walk by people who look so hardened to life, who
have so many cares written across their faces, and yet are
spontaneously warm when i simply open my mouth. that kind of
grittiness and generosity humbles me. amy winehouse was beautiful
because she was unrelentingly real. people fixate on her tattoos,
drinking, and beehive, but wasn't it obvious that she had a heart
that was incredibly pure and brave. death can be beautiful because
it teaches us to value life.<br />
<br />
those are the kinds of thoughts that go through my head quite
naturally. but i'm often surprised by how much people shy away from
talk that touches them. so, for most of the world, i am cheerful
and active or quiet and mundane - that is also me, just not all of
me - but my closest people understand my default frequency.<br />
<br />
still there? more?<br />
<br />
my other passions since childhood have been nature, animals, and
the environment. it is ironic because i am in a career that often
requires me to seclude myself inside a library or windowless
office. it is also ironic because, while i have an activist bent
toward those topics, my chosen career highly values objective
research and scholarship. so, i live in contradictions. but i think
the psyche works in strange ways, such that what we think doesn't
make sense at all actually makes sense. as in - i should have been
a writer + i should be an advocate for animals + i am addicted to
understanding things from all points of view, which is as close to
objectivity as we can ever get = i write in a scholarly field that
makes me question my biases while researching the topics that
excite me. and the amazing thing about the human urge is that shit
like that falls into place rather unconsciously for, i think,
everyone.<br />
<br />
or, i am incredibly privileged to be able to think through such
options in the first place, and most people do what they must. no,
i don't completely believe that. every person has some element of
agency.<br />
<br />
the mundane -<br />
i live in oakland with my fuzzies, farley and misha. jackson,
another fuzzy, died about six weeks ago, so i have been trying to
figure out what connection a box of ashes has to the breathing,
jumping, loud, i-love-you-so-much beautiful hunk of a cat i shared
my life with everyday. it's weird.<br />
<br />
i study political science and am working on getting a ph.d. ""what
are you going to do with that?"" you ask. hopefully one day i will
become a professor in one of my favorite cities in the u.s.<br />
<br />
given the funds and time, i love to travel - really, who doesn't?
but people vary wildly in where they choose to go and what they do.
my vacations tend to include museums, cities, natural landscapes,
national parks, and tourist sites - ideally all, but roughly in
that order of preference. i have been to taiwan, hong kong,
thailand, vietnam, cambodia, malaysia, singapore, laos, china,
guatemala, london and paris very briefly, and not nearly enough
states in the u.s. i love the ocean.<br />
<br />
i need zen space from time to time to, you know, get in touch with
my inner goddess. that includes things like snuggling in bed all
day with novels, aimless grocery shopping, people watching, and
really girlie stuff like facials and painting my nails. i like that
feeling of tired accomplishment after a productive day.<br />
<br />
when i laugh, it might be a girlish giggle, an undignified cackle,
or a deep rumble from the belly. sometimes i can be funny, but i
think you'll be funnier. i promise not to make you work hard for my

in general, i feel like i have been relatively fortunate in my

love. the clincher seems to be finding someone i feel connected to
in the right ways who also wants the same things that i want. i
have met a number of people who seem to be in one category or the

so, alas, my quest continues","working as a program director/acting executive director at a

and homelessness issues.<br />

work and politics have always been a pretty big part of my life but
in the last few years i've tried to be a little more
balanced.<br />

i've begun to spend more time doing things like cooking (in an
effort to eat healthier food but i also really enjoy the process

home improvement projects (though it would be nice if they were to
my own home)<br />

<br />
recent fiction has been the girl trilogy by stieg larsson, and
the glass castle by jeanette wells (memoir but reads like fiction);
non-fiction: ""hobos, hustlers and backsliders: homeless in san
francisco"" by teresa gowan &amp; ten years that shook the city
about sf from 1968-1978 (which a couple of my friends have chapters
in); and food books by michael pollan.<br />
<br />
another recent favorite was ""moneyball"" by michael lewis. this one
appealed to both my love of baseball, and my respect for people who
can think outside the box.<br />

my favorite movie directors are the coen brothers, robert altman,

female vocalists (lucinda williams, michelle shocked, be good

i was born and raised in the bay area, went <em>all the way across
el camino</em> (such a long trip!) for college, and then moved to
within six blocks of my childhood home. nonetheless, i'm fairly
well traveled (four continents thus far), multilingual (spanish,
italian, a little bit of hebrew, chinese, java, and latex), and (i
think) a pretty darn engaging conversationalist. please don't hold
my overuse of parentheses against me; it's a family disease for

i asked him why, he gasped, ""you just have...so...much...energy!!""

famous ones), at home in my garden (my bok choy is growing a little
<em>too</em> well--it's a little worrisome, frankly--i fear it
might take over the local government), and in the pool swimming
laps. i'm a voracious reader (no, really, i often walk out of the
library with 8-10 books and finish them within a couple of weeks),
with my current kicks being historical biographies/stories (david
mccullough's book on the panama canal started me off), food
politics (lots of michael pollan), and all of the recent ""hot""
dystopian fiction (game of thrones, the hunger games).<br />

been occasionally known to say something like ""i haz a angree."" i'm
quite geeky on the dr. who, hitchhiker's guide,
technology-in-general, and xkcd axes--but not on the gaming or
monty python axes. i can program, but my sql skills are woefully

be worse).","","seeing what's coming over the horizon--and i'm getting better at

interesting enough for an essay. let's talk food! i'm a terrific
cook (and i'm not the only one who says that). i can wing it with
american, italian, mexican, some hungarian, and generic asian foods
(but i don't make tamales, and i sometimes rely on dried garlic for
my sauces). i need some level of recipe for specific chinese,
japanese, and thai dishes, and i'm woefully dependent on recipes

god for mobility-in-work). its hard to complain about the long
commute as its hard to complain about either city. the
nitty-gritty: grew up in berkeley, lived in sf for 9 years, spent 8
back east (in different stints, in ny and washington, d.c.) and am
happily back in the best state.","i'm a magazine editor ... which i love. truth, though, is its a bit

awesome, so no complaints here either.","breathing, walking, eating, and sleeping, for starters.","my eyes.","books: all i've read lately are magazines, but lets say anything by
junot diaz. movies: everything from tropic thunder to lars and the
real girl. shows: just saw the globe theater do comedy of errors,

80s punk). food; yep. love it. no eggplant please.","a good read. my friends. my house in san francisco. ice cream. good
music for a long drive. a long hike as often as possible. and a
good long paddle with my outrigger team.","how to make a fantastic magazine in this crazy world of too many

<br />
anyway, i've been in the bay area almost 15 years now after growing
up in sac. i got tired of people saying how great sacramento is,
you know... with the river and all, so i moved out ""west"" and been
loving it ever since. ""the city"" is just a few miles away and it's
got something for everyone. i've explored all parts of sf and have
stories that will put any ""shock and awe"" campaign to shame!<br />
<br />
some things i enjoy... giants games, great restaurants, wine
festivals, action movies and other ""guy"" stuff. traveling is
something i do a few times a year. i'm currently looking for a
travel companion who isn't afraid of exploring those little areas
off the beaten path. of course, there's also nothing wrong with
just staying home and enjoying a movie or watching one of my
favorite shows such as 'restaurant impossible"" on the food
network.<br />
<br />
just got back from a trip to the turks and caicos islands. believe
me, there's nothing like the feeling you get when trying to steer
your way out of the ""dead zone"" on a sailboat with a french
speaking guide and two other novices who speak no english! we
survived, but it was one incredible experience!","i've always wanted to live in a van down by the river, but college
got in the way of that. ;) for those who appreciate an snl

escape, business stuff, keeping things neat and organized. it
annoys the hell out of one of my co-workers.","my shadow. it's always following me around and people usually
notice it first.","action movies, sports, computer work, guy stuff. restaurant
impossible on the food network. although chef robert has nothing on

""one thing."" and that one thing is an unbelievably satisfying and
fulfilling long term relationship with the right person.<br />
<br />
what did you think i was talking about???<br />
<br />
i want someone who is ready to settle down. although it can be
great at times, you are done with being single and want to turn the
page on that part of life. you're considered a nice person with a
good family and a total catch. your friends can't understand how it
is that you're still available. i believe that two people must
compliment each other and that opposites attract. i'm not talking
about race, religion, or politics, but simply personality.<br />
<br />
some things i like doing as a couple... going to giant's games, a
nice relaxing napa wine tasting day concluding with a jaunt over to
indian hot springs for a dip in the hot pool! going to all the
great restaurants the bay area has to offer. traveling to tropical
locations. but of course, it's not really about what you do but who
you're with that makes a great time.<br />

sentences in so you might not recognize my select species of
sarcasm yet, hence the asterisks) but realize that it's a slippery
slope to self-absorption, so i actively try to turn my gaze
outwards and am usually shocked (asterisks) to find that thinking
about the world is invariably more interesting than thinking about
myself. travel comes more naturally to me than routine, though i
tend to suffer from mundane existential crises wherever i am (and
always laugh about it afterwards). i'm more project-oriented than
travel-bound at the moment, but i suspect living and pursuing

makes public nudity accepable (if you practice any of these, oh do
say hello; i'm new to the bay and looking for creative
scenes/outlets). my love affair with capoeira began a couple of
years ago and has spanned several continents. though i'm currently
injured, it remains my quasi spiritual and musical outlet. that

the outdoors. a native new yorker, i grew up sailing on the hudson,

i think an indicator of how society has compromised humanity is the
pervasively reinforced misconception that love must be learned,
freedom must be strived for, and creativity is a golden commodity
reserved for the gifted few. i see complacency, cowardice, and
narrow-mindedness as the biggest culprits. correspondingly, i
gravitate towards the unusual, the outrageous, the breaking of
convention; towards a life without limitations; towards anyone and

incense, documenting faces and places, and mounting mobile theater
productions with local artists along the way. unfortunately, i got
injured playing capoeira and had to come home to have surgery on my

empty space, imagine: how creativity works by jonah lehrer, society
without government by tannehill and wollstein, profit over people

first as tragedy, then as farce by slavoj zizek (kind of hilarious

my jewish mom picked my middle name, in honor of her eastern
european relatives that died in the holocaust. this dichotomy,
being half latin american and half ashkenazi, is an aspect of my
identity that is the explanation for my profile name. ganef is the
yiddish word for bad man. menchn is a spanishified play on the
yiddish word for good person.<br />

catholic puerto rico, i can summon a latin chant for easter mass,
or a puertorican folk song to praise baby jesus.<br />

<br />
i read anywhere from 5-9 books a week. they vary from sci-fi to
non-fiction to sometimes even textbooks. (maybe this belongs in the
most private things section....but....i also read cheesy romance
novels)<br />
<br />
i'm less obsessive about movies, though am still a great lover of
them. i probably wont recognize the random movie quote you throw
out. but i do love watching them. from cheesy rom-coms to indie
films and documentaries.<br />
<br />
music is always in my life, but i have no idea who sang it, what
the band is called or what the title of the song it. i just know i
like it. though lately i've been on a old jazz kick. think ella and
louis and the duke.<br />

mmmm...food. i am obsessed about food. don't get me started about
food. :) seriously. don't get me started. i might not stop.","1. green tea in the morning, at noon and at night.<br />
2. things to read whether it be books, instruction manuals or the
side of milk cartons.<br />
3. knee high sock. many many many pairs of knee high socks.
:)<br />
4. friends to make me laugh and keep me sane.<br />
5. &lt; insert something witty here &gt;<br />
6. champagne. i'm not an alcoholic, but really, champagne. it's the
all around best thing to celebrate with, commiserate with, or
really....just plain drink. mmmmm. fizzy.","why the caffeine in green tea doesn't make me jittery yet a single

<br />

on a good deal now.<br />

<br />
what to cook for dinner.<br />

rely on the fact that i live at the top of a hill and my house has
way too many stairs and therefore my gluts are fine with all that

bangs or no bangs, that is the question. (i finally have really

but i don't want to lose the length....so *points at stuff outside

need a change! so i quit my job, packed up my stuff, said goodbye
to my friends in boston  and set off for new adventures in san
francisco. i didn't have a job lined up and didn't know a single
soul on the west coast. and against all odds, i am loving it here.
having just spent the day at a job i actually like, and a wonderful
evening catching up with old friends, i'm now relaxing in my warm,
comfortable apartment, and i can't help but think ""damn - life is
good!""<br />
<br />
about me: i'm a fun, smart, unpretentious gal who's a little
quirky, a little dorky and a little silly. i like tennis, ken burns
documentaries, pub crawls, npr and karaoke (i do an awesomely bad
rendition of livin' on a prayer). i think exploring all the kitschy
little shops in the mission and wandering through a museum are
perfect ways to while away a lazy sunday afternoon. i have great
respect for the environment and try to do my part to lessen my
carbon footprint. i have a pretty good sense of who i am, which is
one of the joys of life once you're in your 30s!","i work in knowledge management for a consulting company, and yes,
it's just as glamorous as it sounds! kidding aside, i actually
enjoy my job, which seems to be a rarity nowadays.<br />
<br />
that said...if i won the lotto, i'd love to get my phd in history
or urban studies (after traveling around the world, giving money to
charities, etc. etc.). i would throw myself into academia if i
didn't have to worry about paying my san francisco rent!","being a friend. listening. offering advice when needed. pub trivia.

i'm in a bit of a music funk - drop me a suggestion for any cool
bands/singers you recommend! i tend to listen to rock, pop and
folk. i have a soft spot for 90s music (sigh gin blossoms) and fun
hip hop. i'm getting more into classical music as of late and have
come to really appreciate handel.<br />

movies: dazed &amp; confused, earth, stand by me, stealing beauty,

the vacation ones, but when they go to cool places like tuscany or

holler.<br />
<br />
on the weekends i read books, watch movies, and meander around the
city. i enjoy the occasional hike, too. standard fair, but hey --
worth mentioning if it's honest, right?<br />

during the holidays my family throws down over <a class=""ilink""

tend to hold a special place in my heart. i have a spitfire
grandma, with a wicked sense of humor. she definitely plays a big
part in this. when grandma sardonically calls you an asshole for
ducking the queen of spades, it's the best.<br />
<br />
when it comes to movies, i'm liable to enjoy <em>almost</em>
anything i see. the ol' netflix queue reflects this: artsy french
films are often sandwiched between summer blockbusters and other
junk.<br />
<br />
in terms of humor, i tend towards off-beat and the odd bit of dark
humor. a list of perennial favorites includes the venture brothers,
maria bamford, louis ck, and arrested development.<br />

my favorite things are thinking (about the world around me and how
it works), playing (nerdy games), and building (meaningful
relationships, or intelligent processes).<br />
<br />
i'm very laid back about life, and find it hard not to focus on the
upside of things. i don't really know yet what i want for the
future, but i'm always looking to keep improving myself and helping
those around me do the same.","working at a fantastic company that's hard to summarize

chess, guessing stuff, convincing you that i'm right :p","either my dashing good looks or irresistible charm... or the fact

i like to read books that make me think, teach me things, or change
me. i read a lot of non-fiction, stuff like malcolm gladwell,
freakonomics, stumbling on happiness and other books about how
people think and work. that's probably my favorite subject in the
world--i'll never get tired of learning more about what makes us
human. in terms of fiction, my favorite authors include isaac
asimov, oscar wilde, and george orwell, but i am always happy to
branch out and try something new.<br />
<br />
like pretty much everyone, i also spend a good amount of time
reading the interweb. reddit, savage love, and clicking all the
blue links in wikipedia articles are among my favorite online
pastimes.<br />
<br />
i will pretty much eat anything, but i love seafood. and i don't
mean buttered lobster, i mean smells-like-the-ocean seafood.
oysters, mussels, clams, octopus etc. are fantastic. mackerel,
herring, anchovies... those are the kinds of fish you can sign me
up for (don't worry, i won't force you to try any). i also
absolutely love sushi in all forms.<br />
<br />
in terms of movies, anything that isn't stupid. i prefer dramas and
movies that tell great stories (e.g. the shawshank redemption, the
usual suspects, the incredibles, jerry mcguire, the matrix, the
american president... these are some varied titles that popped into
my head just now). but i'll also enjoy comedies and chick flicks if
they are witty and not predictable.<br />
<br />
i rarely hear music i don't like, so i can't say i have a
particular taste. i enjoy pop, jazz, rap, classical, folk, dubstep,
techno and pretty much anything that isn't too angry; i just put on
whatever fits the mood. currently it's rjd2, nicholas jaar, james
blake, gotye, glitch mob, &amp; lykke li, but who knows what it'll
be next week. one thing i will say is that i absolutely love to

<br />
i live in pomona during the months of late september until early
june!!!! so you know, i am only staying in the san mateo, san
francisco and redwood city areas for the duration of the summer,
and will return to pomona at the end of september.<br />
<br />
i tend to write a lot, just a forewarning.<br />
<br />
-end disclaimer-<br />
<br />
i am now (as of the start of the fall quarter) a fourth year
student at cal poly pomona. i am majoring in agricultural science
and education (it's a single major, just two parts... not sure why
it has a two major name...) minoring in regenerative studies as
well as attempting to get a minor/certificate in chinese -
mandarin. i plan to gain a masters degree in regenerative studies,
as well. i am learning mandarin since people who wish to work for
an international organization (united nations, for example) need to
know at least three languages.<br />
<br />
for all intents and purposes, i am 21. i am 5'5.75"" at 69kg (about
151lbs). yes, i have it down to a scale of quarter inches,
according to my physical last year.<br />
<br />
to put this out there, early on: if you chew with your mouth open,
don't bother contacting me. if you talk with your mouth full, don't
bother contacting me. if you are morbidly obese, don't bother
talking about me. everyone has their pet peeves, these are
mine.<br />
<br />
i am an honorable and respectful person, from what i've been told.
i've been called sweet, kind, caring and understanding. i do my
best to help those in need (of whom i'm able to directly help). i
do my best to do kind things for others; chivalry has not yet
died.<br />
<br />
i have a fascination with chinese culture and history. i wish to
learn everything i can about china. that does not mean i am only
interested in chinese women. race matters not to me. all that
matters are that i am slightly physically attracted to you (come
on, physical attraction is needed at least a little bit for a
successful relationship, don't kid yourself), and that you meet my
personality requirements (basically don't act like a five year
old... ever! yes, a lot of women act like children, and so do a lot
of men. i won't stand for it). i absolutely hate drama, if you have
it go elsewhere.<br />
<br />
however, i'm mainly looking for friends or pen pals. just people to
talk to. i enjoy long and deep conversations. my typical email is
about 10 paragraphs long, with about 5-6 sentences in each. now
then, that's at an average. there are those times, when in a
passionate conversation, where i'd write much more. i'm told ""women
are intimidated by men who can write a lot. men shouldn't care that
much about connections."" anonymous okcupid user whom i won't name.
yes, i was told this. the majority of women who say this kind of
thing have on their profile ""i'm looking for a thoughtful and
caring guy."" *in i come with an email* ""go away."" haha, double
standards, much? seriously, if you can't handle having a thoughtful
person in your life of the male sex, then please go
elsewhere.<br />
<br />
i am happy the way i am. some people think i'm cold because i don't
like morbidly obese people, or talking with one's mouth full, or
chewing with the mouth open. i hate those 3 things about humanity,
and i am perfectly fine without them. i am the only person in my
family not at risk for diabetes or obesity. in fact, according to
my doctor, i am underweight until i am 160 lbs. i have no intention
to gain weight. in fact, i wouldn't mind dropping back down to 140
(which will be my goal once school starts again).<br />
<br />
i used to do cross country and track, as well as badminton. i take
pride in health, and so should you. i want to be fit. why? when fit
parents have a child, the child is more likely to be fit as well.
this means a lower risk of heart problems, indirectly.<br />
<br />
i believe in karma. not that bull about how if you do something
bad, something bad will happen to you. that's not how karma works.
look up buddhism. i'd consider myself somewhat buddhist. i would
love to meet some new friends who are buddhist and will help me in
my journey. i am only just beginning in this journey, and i have
much to learn (started an interest in buddhism only a year ago).
respect my views, and i shall respect yours. respect me and i shall
respect you. i start off respecting all people, and will even
respect you if you cross me, actually. all i ask in return is that
you respect me, and you shall have my thanks.","i am a fourth year university student majoring in agricultural
science and education, minoring in regenerative studies as well as
a certificate/minor in chinese - mandarin. i haven't started
mandarin yet, so please don't type in simplified or traditional. i
can understand *some* pinyin, but that's limited to calling a girl
pretty/beautiful, telling someone you love them or saying hi.<br />
<br />
i'm looking for a part time job to help pay for college, and save
up for a much needed vacation to another country.<br />
<br />
i'm starting my journey into buddhism and to hopefully, one day,
whether in this life or the next (or a further one), reach nirvana.","cooking<br />
<br />
observation and deduction. noticing details most can't see right
away. sherlock holmes stated in a game of shadows that he had a
curse of seeing everything. i am, unfortunately, the same way as
well as remembering everything that holds a significant meaning (as
in if i can relate to it or if it interests me, i won't forget it
no matter how hard i try). i'm not trying to be arrogant with that,
i'm just stating things about me and you may take it however you
wish. it's both good (for classes) and bad (remembering things i
wish i can forget, but can't).<br />
<br />
i guess you could say i'm pretty good at math and physics, as well.
i almost have a physics minor, but i'm not allowed to pursue it,
according to my advisor, otherwise it would endanger my major,
which i don't see how it could (other than the fact that most of my
physics and math courses were waived due to my testing above all
courses for the major and minor, except for two in my minor).
because i got a waiver, i can't take the classes. if i get the
minor with the waiver, i'd need to take the classes to count for my
major too... again, i can't take classes so i had to give up the
minor for the major.","i write too much. i think too much (more analyzing than thinking,
doing cost-benefit analysis all the time for personal choices). in
addition, my teeth are pretty messed up due to a surgery i had when
i was two, and i just haven't been able to afford another surgery i
need (wisdom teeth) in order to start getting them fixed. just
throwing that out there if you *need* your friends to have perfect
teeth... then i'm not eligible for your friend.","books:<br />

movies:<br />
mostly foreign movies. too many to list. i love any foreign
action/adventure movie, as well as most foreign drama or...
anything foreign. i'm going through a bunch of japanese, arabic and
spanish movies at this time. i've been known to watch many korean,
cantonese and mandarin films (yes, there's a difference between the
two dialects of chinese, accept that fact). i really enjoy most of
anything with andy lau or takeshi kaneshiro. chibi is, by far, one
of the greatest movies ever (part 1 and part 2, and hopefully part
3 when they make it).<br />

arsenic and old lace, and roman holiday. it must be obvious that i

whereas elementary students would wear their emotions, their likes
and dislikes and their wants and needs on their sleeves, college
students and adults can hide their yearnings a little better, but
from their mannerisms, they are still, ultimately, the same. i
would like to dedicate my life to creating a new system of
education that embodies the best aspects of traditional chinese
education: discipline, memorization and sheer quantity of a variety
of knowledge; with key elements of american education: discussion,
learning from teachers and students alike and practical application
of learned knowledge. this is a distant dream, but i believe i can
make it into a lifetime accomplishment that will certainly leave a
mark for future generations.<br />
<br />
i would also like to reacquaint people from our modern world with
memorable episodes in chinese history. there are so many lessons
and so many examples that would have served as guides to modern
tacticians and politicians alike. i fear that modern politicians
have a tendency to regard only science, technology and their own
problems as having never been experienced in history before. and
so, history is repeating itself. as a historian, i believe there is
a great deal of wisdom lost and with the right venues, can be
re-introduced into popular culture. this would also be a unique
business to establish and maintain.","i am very articulate, at the risk of being verbose.<br />

lifetime accomplishments.<br />

i love the final fantasy series, though i haven't the time to play
any more now.<br />
<br />
now that i can afford all the consoles i liked as a kid, i no
longer have any time to play them.<br />
<br />
i love to write new role paying games (rpg) scenarios that
incorporate elements of chinese and japanese history, and place
more european and or magical/fantasy characters to see how they
interact. this also gives me many ideas for writing short stories
and novels.<br />

gasoline prices now hinder me from doing so.<br />

i love to volunteer for community service, though i absolutely
despise panhandlers and people asking for money.<br />

i don't know if i believe in god, though i believe in destiny,
fate, the mandate of heaven and most of all, in providence!<br />
<br />
i am not religious, yet i say grace before my meals.<br />
<br />
i have a passion for languages, though i am fluent in only
two.<br />
<br />
i love tales from ancient chinese history, though few people my age
share this hobby.<br />

i have taught college english for the past six years, though i
still enjoy playing with legos in my spare time.<br />

seemingly endless resource of historical texts and quotations, a
completely versatile taste in music, food and activities. if there
were any stereotypes of what a chinese-american man would be, i
have deliberately and unabashedly broken most of them: i don't
drive a honda, accura nor toyota; i am not into the sciences; i
don't speak english with an accent (except possibly texan english
when i am really angry); i slam academics though i am one; i can
last longer than most of my friends at endurance related sports; i
can converse just as passionately about classical music as well as
rap; i can recognize the subtleties in taste in wines, liqueurs and
teas; i am inward well organized, and outwardly messy... for this
latter point, i will take sherlock holmes as my defense, though i
don't have a housekeeper nor a habit of practicing the revolver

novel practically. perhaps you will find the main character as
endearing, couragous, and affable as i do. (ok got the cheesyness
out of my system now heh ;).<br />
<br />
so i was born in washington state but raised in the bay, and
consider myself a californian, although most of my family is still
in washington.<br />
<br />
(note: read the whole paragraph below before jumping to
conclusions)<br />
i am a priest and have taken a vow a celebacy, so if we get
involved the only sexual activity will be verbally describing
coitus to each other like two quadriplegics would. i assure you i
have a vivid imagination however and am very well spoken.<br />
wait a minute that was just a nightmare i had once, never
mind.<br />
<br />
i'm fascinated by human behavior, philosophy, the esoteric, art in
its vast array of expressions, pop culture (primarily for
sociological purposes), cuisine, comedy and enjoy a good game of
billiards.<br />
<br />
i'm an extrovert at heart and enjoy being social. i am beyond
blessed to have the friends that i do. seriously they are the
stuff.<br />
i do have introverted tendencies and enjoy my solitude at times.
finding the balance is an ongoing goal of mine.<br />
<br />
i'm an optimist who occasionally uses skepticism to sift through
b.s.<br />
i'm quite fiery and passionate, piercingly opinionated however my
primary demeanor is easy going / laid back. keep in mind poking the
lion is ill advised even if looking sleepy. actually, especially if
looking sleepy. you won't get bitten, but may here my roar.<br />
<br />
i enjoy a good debate for stimulation. as well as the expansion,
exchange, solidification, and reforming of ideas. although i am not
one to pick fights, if you say something foolish or ignorant i'm
gonna call you on it. i'm pretty gentle though, typically :)<br />
<br />
i root for the underdog usually.<br />
discrimination and bullying i can't turn a blind eye to.<br />
<br />
i am determined to learn how to surf this year<br />
i'm teaching myself to dance better, although not sure why as last
time i checked i'm still hetrosexual.<br />
i'd like to learn spanish.<br />
i prefer playing sports to spectating.<br />
<br />
work i don't talk about much, as it isn't a significant defining
point of who i am. i do however love my career, have great bosses,
greatly enjoy the company of my co-workers and never tire of the
financial district. i am blessed.<br />

i don't believe in an afterlife, so i don't have to spend my whole
life fearing hell, or fearing heaven even more. for whatever the
tortures of hell, i think the boredom of heaven would be even
worse.  isaac asimov<br />
<br />
the only people for me are the mad ones, the ones who are mad to
live, mad to talk, mad to be saved, desirous of everything at the
same time, the ones who never yawn or say a commonplace thing, but
burn, burn, burn, like fabulous yellow roman candles exploding like
spiders across the stars, and in the middle, you see the blue
center-light pop, and everybody goes ahh...  jack kerouac<br />
<br />
some men see things and ask why? i dream things and ask why not? 
george bernard shaw<br />
<br />
here's to the crazy ones. the misfits. the rebels. the
troublemakers. the round pegs in the square holes. the ones who see
things differently. they're not fond of rules. and they have no
respect for the status quo. you can quote them, disagree with them,
glorify or vilify them. about the only thing you can't do is ignore
them. because they change things. they push the human race forward.
and while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius.
because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change
the world, are the ones who do.  apple<br />

how vain it is to sit down to write when you have not stood up to
live.<br />
i wish to suggest that a man may be very industrious, and yet not
spend his time well. there is no more fatal blunderer than he who
consumes the greater part of his life getting his living. all great
enterprises are self-supporting. the poet, for instance, must
sustain his body by his poetry, as a steam planing-mill feeds its
boilers with the shavings it makes. you must get your living by
loving.  henry david thoreau<br />
<br />
borders: i have never seen one. but i have heard they exist in the
minds of some people.  thor heyerdahl<br />
<br />
the law changes and i don't. how i stand vis--vis the law at any
given moment depends on the law. the law can change from state to
state, from nation to nation, from city to city. i guess i have to
go by a higher law. how's that? yeah, i consider myself a road man
for the lords of karma.  hunter s. thompson<br />
<br />
your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life.
don't be trapped by dogma  which is living with the results of
other people's thinking. don't let the noise of others' opinions
drown out your own inner voice. and most important, have the
courage to follow your heart and intuition. they somehow already
know what you truly want to become. everything else is
secondary.<br />
<br />
the only way to do great work is to love what you do. if you
haven't found it yet, keep looking. don't settle. as with all
matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it.<br />
<br />
what a computer is to me is the most remarkable tool that we have
ever come up with. it's the equivalent of a bicycle for our

you work on your computer when you want to turn your brain

first terminator has some surpirsingly romantic moments, and the
first sex scene i ever saw. event horizion's the only movie i ever
saw that really scared me. if i keep on going, you'll find out that
most of my favorite movies involve either spaceships or robots, if
not monty python, and i don't know how i feel about you knowing

grew up in the bay area, love it here and not planning on leaving.
i think im pretty easy going, but can be pretty passionate about
some of my favorite topics.(music, sports, work, friends) i also
have a sarcastic, dry, and sometimes wacky sense of humor. this
usually doesnt come out until i get to know you better(or unless
you challenge me right off the bat... then its on!), but its safe
to say that when im with my friends im usually making people laugh.
i even invented my own dance.(dont ask, you wont learn about it
until you've earned it. ha!)<br />
<br />
i think it is strange how sf is such a segregated place when it
comes to people in different neighborhoods. i feel like every one
is so extreme here. i think i the type of person who will fit in
anywhere. i love to grab a drink at a dive bar in the mission or
maybe hit up a wine bar in pac heights. hopefully you can
too.<br />
<br />
i also love to get out and do things like snowboard, water ski,
hike, or play a round of frisbee golf. really im down for all sorts
of activities and i feel like anything can be fun if you are doing
it with the right people.","living in sf and working as a software engineer/web developer
consultant. i enjoy my job, but its not my life. i work to live and
not the other way around.","listing to people and finding out what they are really saying and
what they want. this helps me out a lot not only professionally,
but in general life situations too.","im not sure. it probably depends on the setting. im a very
different person at work or when im hanging out with friends.","i love to watch movies. doesn't really have to be a good movie just
something entertaining and fun. it helps me unwind from my
day.<br />
also, im also passionate about music. that doesnt mean that im out
there going to tons of shows, but i do go to a few throughout the
year. i love to dance, sing(not well), play guitar, and listen to
my favorite tunes while working, running, or cooking dinner.<br />

have consumed most of my life. i really loved dream boy by jim
grimsley though the movie was a little lacking in my opinion. i
used to love the redwall series when i was younger (though i'm sure
i still would if i reread them). harry potter was a good series
even if i wanted to punch harry most of the time. i have a long
list of books i want to read given the time, among which include
michael thomas ford's book that came out like 2 years ago (again
haven't read in a while) and several neil gaiman books.<br />
<br />
movies: i have to say that my all time favorite is lilo and stitch
though i really love my disney movies (it's mostly the music). i
tend to stray towards romantic comedies and the like though i can
really go for most any movie that keeps me entertained without to
much blood and gore (i'm a bit squeamish). i really can't do any
sort of horror though. i freaked out at gremlins, i was like six or
seven but still. horror + me = really bad...<br />
<br />
music: nickel creek, bond, daft punk, cascada, twelve girls band
and lady gaga, just to name a few. and of course all the classic
90's pop like backstreet boys, n*sync, spice girls, bb mack, ect.
basically if i can dance to it i like it. i have to say though i
tend to like individual songs more than artists themselves. i've
recently gotten into jay sean, owl city, leona lewis and vv
brown.<br />

food: my absolute favorite kind of food is japanese. i could live
off of sushi and miso. it is amazing. i am really good with almost
any form of seafood or pasta as long as its not too spicy. i am a

i seem to test as a ""7"" on the enneagram
(http://www.enneagraminstitute.com/). i'm an adventurer,
enthusiast, &amp; epicurean who juggles multiple projects at once
and is a creator, connector, entrepreneur and people person. i am
up to big things in life, and want a partner who will support my
purpose. my life has been amazing, and it's about to get a lot
better with you, my queen.<br />
<br />
i've had a vision of our shared partnership i call sippeee:
spiritual, intellectual, playful, physical, emotional, ethical and
energetic. our experience together might be something ike
this:<br />
<br />
spiritual: together we explore the world of spirituality, are open
minded to constantly learn, and we may be curious about the idea
that all spiritual practice, religion, nature and philosophy may
somehow be interconnected.<br />
<br />
intellectual: we enjoy discussing philosophy, spirituality, nature,
politics, economics, human nature and the world together. we strive
to improve our minds both together and separately on our own paths.
we are open minded to new ideas and experiences and ways of
thinking, but we both can respect each other having our own,
sometimes very different opinions about the world.<br />
<br />
physical: we share a common philosophy about health, tend toward a
vegetarian diet and strive be light on addictive or harmful
substances. we enjoy cooking at home and preparing organic
nourishing meals for ourselves, our family and our friends. we like
to hike, explore and play outdoors and in exotic countries.<br />
<br />
our bodies are healthy and compatible, and we are highly attracted
to each other. we share a deep sexual chemistry that deepens with
our relationship. we are attracted to each others energy above all
else, and want to ravage each other even into old age (how cool
would that be? :). we enjoy giving each other touch in all ways,
from deep cuddles, massage, holding hands, and caressing to
sensitive lovemaking and animalistic ravaging.<br />
<br />
playful: together we are spontaneous, silly, happy, flexible,
optimistic, adventurous, goofy, laughing, tumbling, wrestling, and
dancing together. we live a daring, fun, engaged, beautiful,
loving, caring, playful life together that we want to share with
the world. we are comfortable playing with all age groups and
discriminate against none.<br />
<br />
ethical: together we live and share a principled life that
cherishes the goodness and love in others. we strive to conduct our
lives with high integrity where we treat each other and those
around us with love, respect, and loyalty. we focus on being
selfless and kind to others, and give love through our generosity
and care.<br />
<br />
we share a high emotional intelligence with a commitment to
communication and expressing our truths to each other and those
around us. we create an exquisite balance of reciprocity,
generosity, caring, supporting, forgiveness and accepting each
other that allows our love to grow more fully. we strive to
understand each other and are deeply committed to a journey of self
examination and discovery.<br />
<br />
emotional: we read each other incredible well. we are present and
have deeply resonate touch and eye contact. i can ""feel"" you and
you can do the same with me with few words exchanged. we share a
deep intuition about the other, and our expressive words confirm
it.<br />
<br />
energetic: we read each others energy, body language, and tonality
extremely well, and understand how to read others. we feel
energized on this journey of life, and want more and more from our
lives. we just won't settle. we are energetic and spontaneous. the
idea of travel, an all night dance party, taking the kids on an
around the world trip, and purposeful, driven work is just as
appealing as lounging together in the morning sun after a hot night
of love making, soaking in the hot springs, or going for a
leisurely walk.<br />
<br />
me?<br />
<br />
i live in a communal vegetarian mansion on a 5 acre estate in san
rafael, right next to a 1,200 acre wild open space (i love hiking,
red tail hawks, and all the trees &amp; animals!). we are creating
a high vibration community event hub for learning, loving, and
transformation, and have an extended family of beautiful beings
coming through the house all the time. it's awesome!<br />
<br />
i also teach people how to unlock their fear to lead a more
successful life. i co-lead the inspiration campaign where we buy
out billboards and other ad space and put amazing crowd sourced
inspirations on them. i am co-founder of a sweet interactive art
project called the heartbeat amplifier. i organize a men's dinner
and chess club (not as geeky as it sounds...really!!). i'm a master
nlp practitioner. i play the halo, a rare hand drum made of steel.
i also love to move my body, be strong and dance!<br />
<br />
i'm a well educated, relatively successful entrepreneur / business
guy, but my life is well balanced with community service, family,
friends and playtime. i'm a world adventurer, a social and business
leader, and most importantly an emotionally intelligent man that
has done a lot of deep work on himself. i'm also generally tender,
affectionate, romantic, honest, caring, loving, stable, masculine,
and super fun to be around.<br />
<br />
what about you? what are the ways you want to be in partnership?
what are you like? i am so curious...<br />
<br />
wink or drop me a note if you think there might be chemistry, or
refer me to a friend you think would be a better match. i do get a
lot of inquiries, and please forgive me for not responding to
everyone, but i would so love to hear from you.<br />

please note i do not check my messages often, so i may not respond
for a long time. apologies. ]<br />
<br />
i've lived many lives in one life, and like the doctor i'm on yet
another incarnation of me.<br />
<br />
i've been a veterinarian's assistant, art teacher, foreign student
advisor, web developer, systems analyst, unofficial caterer, and
engineer. i've worked in public schools, startups, colleges, and
aerospace.<br />
<br />
in my current incarnation, i am:<br />
<br />
- living in cohousing (my neighbours and i share a community
organic garden, workshop, craft room, kid's playroom, pool, and
other cool things)<br />
- disabled (i am hoping this is temporary, but i do not know... the
best advice i can give you in dealing with me is a) be really
flexible, b) accept my moving slowly, c) make sure wherever we go
is ada compliant, and d) have backup plans if i cancel.)<br />
- non-monogamous or polyamorous (i have 3 partners at
present.)<br />
- a co-parent. (i'm helping take care of a 10 yr old girl.)<br />
- not working. (because i am too disabled to consistently hold down
a job at present.)<br />
- spending time pursuing more intellectual, creative, and spiritual
pursuits. (in other words, reading, writing, drawing, and
meditating more; walking around less. journeying inward more than
outside.)<br />
- communing with my garden. (it's something i can do in bits and
pieces with no deadline, which is easier to do w/ my disability.
even if i weren't disabled, i'd do it. i love to garden.)<br />
- cooking at home a lot and eating out a lot less. (i love to cook,
but i also have a weird diet and this ensures i eat what i want and
need.)<br />
- really tired. (see exhausted, fatigued, low energy, low on
spoons, etc.)<br />
- seeking friendship. (people to meet in person to talk over coffee
with; people to spend time together creating art with in the same
room and encouraging each other w/ projects, or even just
interesting people to chat with online.)<br />
- writing more parenthetical statements (why? i don't know why.
perhaps i've decided they're fun!)","i've done a lot more in the past than i'm currently doing, but it's
relative?<br />
<br />
i've worked in it for a number of years, doing web development and
working for various scientific and research institutions as well as
internet startups. i've also worked as an educator (us grades k-12)
and worked with cultural exchange programs and students from
different countries.<br />
<br />
i'm a world traveller and love to go overseas as well as travel
around my own backyard. if given a choice, i'd be working and
travelling to australia and south america this year, but alas, it's
not going to happen now.<br />
<br />
right now i'm effectively disabled, and i'm still trying to have a
life despite it. i am hoping this period of disability won't last
forever, and if it does, that eventually i improve to the point
where it has less of an impact on my ability to do things at home,
at work, at play, and socialising... *sigh*<br />
<br />
as it stands, i am focusing more on the things which i can do for
small stretches and require less energy... there is, for example, a
huge netflix queue i need to work through, and i am an avid
indie/foreign film lover. i also have books i want to finish, arts
and crafts i'd like to try, and perhaps even write my own book if i
can focus long enough to do so.","- finding childlike wonder in the little things in life, like a
hummingbird flying in a 360 degree circle, unusual flowers,
hands-on science museum exhibits, and rocks i find in the
desert.<br />
- making friends from all different walks of life.<br />
- coming up with solutions to problems from distinctly different
areas of knowledge/expertise... at least that's what my former boss
told me.<br />
- singing. generally do best with singing those low bluesy numbers
and not ""queen of the night"", though it's fun to try once in a
while.<br />
- drawing and painting; arts and crafts. not only was i a biology
major -- i was an art major in college -- and remain
interested.<br />
- research. i've been able to find items and information online
that are so obscure, people shake their heads at me. it's a
hobby.<br />
- being an agony aunt for my friends... and i'm good at keeping
their secrets, too.<br />
- coming up with new recipes on the fly based on ingredients on
hand.<br />
- making a space comfortable and welcoming for company.<br />
- gardening. i would like to explore the possibilities of making
gardening an extreme sport.<br />
- photography. at least, this is what my friends have told me, and
they tell me i should do more.<br />
- travelling. or so my boyfriend tells me, and he loves to travel
with me whenever i'm up to it.<br />
- extreme hot tubbing. this is not to be confused with sauna
competitions in europe (now cancelled), since it really isn't that
extreme. just lengthy.<br />
- seeing potential points of failure. this was great for some of my
jobs... not so great for daily living, though.<br />
- swimming, snorkeling, and in the best of times, scuba!<br />
- when not so disabled, i was pretty good at dancing and hiking...
*sigh* now i'm not doing either.","physically, they notice my smile, my brown-green eyes, and my
hips.<br />
<br />
past that, once they talk to me they might notice i use a mix of
englishes (american, british, canadian, and australian). a
linguistics teacher has had a field day trying to figure out where
i'm from because my vowels shift.<br />
<br />
occasionally i walk with a limp and use a cane. this is a
relatively new thing, and while some people notice, some people
don't -- especially since it's the nature of my disability that
what level of functionality i have changes. so some people may
notice i'm disabled, but some people might not, and won't notice
that until they get to know me better.<br />
<br />
other things people notice:<br />
<br />
i'm an outlier... in a number of ways, i'm two standard deviations
outside the norm. i am also on the fringe of many different
alternative social groups and organisations, but never right in the
thick of them.<br />
<br />
i have a wide range of interests from the artistic and sublime to
the scientific and spiritual. i identify with paganism, buddhism,
and agnosticism in their own way, and pantheism as well, but i
don't think i fit into any of them as if they were neatly-defined
little boxes.<br />
<br />
i'm not particularly dogmatic about anything. i like to listen to
all sides of a story, and i sometimes make friends with people who
are considerably different from myself in part because i want to
see things from a different perspective.<br />
<br />
i am not monogamous, i am in an open relationship. i have more than
one partner and love more than one partner, and they all know about
each other, and it's fine. this seems to offend some people,
surprise others, and lead to curious questions. to which i often
can't say much, other than this is my life and i've been in open
relationships since my early 20s -- most of my adult life -- and it
is totally normal for me. *shrug*<br />
<br />
i'm an extrovert with introverted leanings. i'll be bright and
articulate for a while in a small group, and quieter in a large
group. if i'm in a particularly noisy venue, i may excuse myself
and leave fairly quickly as i don't handle crowds well.<br />
<br />
i value nonviolent communication (nvc). while i love a good debate,
if things get particularly heated i'd prefer to use nvc, and if i
can't, i'd prefer to back off the conversation until things cool
down.<br />
<br />
i can have a horribly geeky sense of humour. i love word play. i
love puns. i love anagrams. i love learning new words and trying
them out on occasion to see if people understand what i'm talking
about. hopefully, i will remember what the new word meant, too!","too many to list in terms of books, movies, and music. i'll have to
think about this for a bit before really responding...<br />
<br />
as for food, that's much easier.<br />
<br />
i am a foodie. i love good food made with fresh quality
ingredients. if that makes me a snob, so be it; i'm trying to put
good things in this body as much as i can.<br />
<br />
i love indian, mexican, thai, japanese, vietnamese, greek, turkish,
lebanese, and many other kinds of dishes. i tend to stay away from
italian and chinese food unless i make it at home myself because i
eat a gluten-free fungus-free diet.","shelter, clean air, clean water, safe delicious food, health care,
clothing.<br />
<br />
i am at times an utterly practical person. i have to wonder how
anyone else could actually do without those things.<br />
<br />
in some ways, this thing okc is asking me to fill out is
ridiculous. =p","- changing my life and adapting to circumstances. at least lately,
this has been my focus, and i may be thinking about this for a
while.<br />
- achievable goals for the future, small and big.<br />
- writing a book or making art. i really need to stop thinking
about that and do it, though... =/<br />
- how disabilities affect people in the social sphere and what
stereotypes and misunderstandings are out there of those who are
disabled.<br />
- relationship and communication dynamics... how people interact
with each other and why.<br />
- gender and gender roles... why does anyone care? why can't i
simply be having a fully human experience and be a well-rounded
person without having the things i do be labelled ""something guys
usually do"" or ""something women usually do""?<br />
- the nature of humanity, and how we have evolved into the beings
we are today.<br />
- mortality. i know, sounds gruesome, i guess, but i do think about
it and from many angles.<br />
- spirituality, religion, skepticism, and atheism. the drive to
believe, and the lack of belief.","either...<br />
- watching a family-friendly movie with an 11 yr old girl i'm
co-parenting.<br />
or<br />
- online chatting with a friend and playing ""scrabble"" with
them.<br />
or<br />
- curled up with a book like ""your inner fish"" or ""the earth's
blanket"".<br />
or<br />
- learning to cook some new gourmet dish for my partners.<br />
or<br />
- drawing for as long as my wrists can handle it.<br />
or<br />
- soaking in the hot tub or bath tub.<br />
or<br />
- sleeping, because i am exhausted.<br />
<br />
that last one, alas, is not too uncommon. i don't go out as much as
i used to, and if i do, generally not on fridays so much.<br />
<br />
on a less typical night, i will be out looking at the stars and
planets with my girlfriend, as she's an astronomer and i love the
night sky, too.","is something i may tell you individually but not broadcast to
everyone online.<br />
<br />
at least this isn't facebook!","- repeating the above: you are looking for friends more than
anything else. i'm not currently looking for new partners. i can't
say what the future will bring, but right now my card doesn't have
room for a new partner.<br />

like to get to know me without the expectation that we'll be doing

my favorite san francisco giants baseball player from my childhood

the teams diehard fans either loved or hated - no middleground. and
i'm guessing that a reason why i liked him then was because i also
liked eating candy a lot in those years - or something along those
lines.....................<br />
<br />
i hadn't updated stuff on here for quite some time (the updating is
mid july, 2011)<br />
<br />
i do currently have a girlfriend - she's currently teaching in
shanghai. i'm always up for meeting new people though. i enjoy all
sorts of activities and so often the most enjoyable ones are the
simplest (least complex) ones.<br />

i'm a native born <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=san+franciscan"">san franciscan</a> who loves this
city and has lived almost all of my life here. part of why i love
this city so much is because it has at least a little dose of
almost everything and even more importantly it has its own
undescribable character (unless if we're talking about longtime sf
newspaper columnist legend herb caen)<br />
<br />
i try to be <a class=""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=low+key"">low
key</a>, take things slowly when possible and enjoy the little
positive things in life - like listening to the birds chirping away
while walking about after the sun rises (and then chirping with
them), talking with someone i've never met on the streetcar/bus,
and so on<br />
<br />
i love sports - watching on tv, listening on the radio, playing
(it's about fun - not always winning!), and going to games. for
going to games i prefer college over pro - a lot of it's because i
went to a lot of college games early in my life and have kept on
going to this day<br />
<br />
i'm very irish and proud of my deep roots (grandparents are from
rural western ireland, still have a lot of family there)<br />
<br />
i like to travel/explore - and it doesn't always have to be far
away. sometimes the best getaways are right in our own
backyard!<br />
<br />
i love public transportation and have since i was very young (and a
note on muni here in sf - it does have its flaws, but it deserves a
lot more credit than it gets)<br />
<br />
in the last few years i have gotten very interested in local
history<br />
<br />
i enjoy discussing pretty much anything, even if it's something i
know nothing about - might as well learn as much as i can while i'm
around! i can have very bold opinions on some issues, but i'm
always willing to listen and sometimes i'll change my opinion
(that's called being willing to change one's mind due to new info,
a different perspective, etc - it is now what a hypocrite
does)<br />
<br />
a heads up on match, friend, enemy percentages - i answered
questions a long time ago and haven't redone them or answered many
more of them. a lot of times i answered even though what i really
think wasn't an option. plus, i like to evaluate situations on a
case by case basis.<br />

i am animated, hella norcal, and totally myself","for most of 2010 i was working for the census (quite an interesting
experience to say the least!) - and until mid april this year i was

lot.<br />
<br />
i also do occassioanl paid work for the family - building upkeep
&amp; maintenance stuff with two apartment buildings that my
grandfather built and we still own<br />
<br />
i went to college at sf state, majoring in urban studies - it goes
into topics like urban planning, community development, and such. i
have had internships and short-term jobs (including a 1 year
americorps position) working with public transportation and
economic revitalization in a neighborhood commercial district in
sf.<br />
<br />
i'm a volunteer tour guide here in sf for san francisco city guides
(psst - free historical walking tours!). city guides is 30 years
old and we have close to 300 guides. usually i lead 1 or 2 walks a
month, but i do more in may and october when we offer a bunch of
additional neighborhood walks. the walks last from 1 1/2 - 2 hours.
i became a guide in may of 2006 - it's funny, you pay $100 for a 3
month training class (every other saturday) to become a volunteer
(err,now i think it's over $200- but hey, nowadays volunteer work
on a resume is useful!). all of the tours that i lead are on the
west side of the city where i've lived for most of my life .<br />

i've never been to disneyland (wait, now i have - tokyo disney!) -
even though i've lived my whole life in california and it doesn't
bother me one bit. growing up, my parents took us on different

vacations like that instead of glitzy yet shallow resorts,
amusement parks, and such<br />

i was born cross eyed, had surgery at 5 months and developed a lazy
left eye. early on my glasses had an enormous prism in a lower
corner. for a few years in my late teens i wore a contact in one
eye (after having the muscle in my left eye tightened big time).
currently i wear glasses only for reading.<br />
<br />
when i was around 1 1/2 my older brother (maybe 3 by then) was
standing behind me at the top of 30 concrete stairs at the bottom
of our block, i was holding dad's hand. my brother had a basketball
in hand, threw it at me. i go tumbling down the stairs. scrapes and
bruises - sure. no pain, no gain! any other effects - no obvious
ones yet....................<br />
<br />
there's an old town in maryland that has my name (different
spelling, with ""sburg"" at the end) and was put on the national
register of historic places - on my birthday (not birthdate -
different year, early 90's)! we were on vacation and saw a sign
(that mentioned the town being put on the national register) as we
drove out of town after having lunch there. and of course, i took a
picture with the sign.","if you've read through most of this and not gotten bored to

if you're looking for someone to play cribbage with - even if
you've never played it before! it's an english card game that uses
a board with peg holes &amp; pegs to keep score. i'm up for playing
other card games too - but i haven't played cribbage in years, and
it's hard to find people who play it or are willing to learn (and
still want to play it after learning!).<br />
<br />
i won't think less of you if you have ""drama"" (whatever that
actually means, seems like everyone has a different definition for
it!) in your life. nobody's perfect, everyone has had different
life experiences, and such. we're all human - just because we go
through hard patches in life doesn't mean we should be left alone
during those times.<br />

message me. i understand if you don't want to tell deep secrets
(same with me!) , but if you won't even mention something that's
just silly or funny it's almost like saying that you can't enjoy
lighthearted humor.","white",75,20000,"other","2012-06-26-13-34","san francisco, california","","straight","likes dogs and likes cats","catholicism and somewhat serious about it","m","pisces and it&rsquo;s fun to think about","no","english (fluently), spanish (okay)","seeing someone"

occasional bursts of anticipated bliss. cut short by the curse of
incompatability, i have learned to be very independent but
certainly prefer the companionship of a woman to share things with.
i just returned from a family wedding and i would have loved to
dance into the night and sit around the breakfast table with my
family the next morning, proud of the woman i was sitting next to.
that day i am confident will come. i'm super easy going and people
say i'm pretty funny... once i get on a roll, there is no stopping
me. i am a humanitarian at heart. i recently relocated to marin
(from portland, or) to launch my life's work as a teacher. a very
close friend refers to me as ""a facilitator of conscious living"".
whatever. i don't take myself too seriously. for now, i would love
to just make new friends to go to a movie, take a hike, explore the
waterways in a kayak, share a weekend breakfast, watch the sunset
with a great glass of wine. . . and on and on and on.","i have spent the last 25 years getting out of rainy oregon. i
raised my two kids and sent them off to college so i moved to marin
and love it here. this is where i will age gracefully... i have
been in the film industry for 10+ years, real estate 20+ years, and
assorted ventures along the way. but now, i'm doing exactly what i
want to do. i founded the karma institute to do workshops for
parents and teens, single moms and dads, and build a network of
really great teachers to offer life-changing experiences that they
will take with them forever.","listening. intuitively knowing what the real underlying issue is.
helping people get what they want. i do life coaching.","i'm easy to be around. i'm funny. considerate.","books and movies that make me think. touch me emotionally. food: i
don't necessarily need a fancy restaurant but the experience of a
meal at a cool hot spot is tops.","i love my friends and family but have developed a philosophy where
i don't feel attached to most things. take everything all away,
it's just stuff. i treasure deeply the pictures of my 2 kids and
they know how much pop loves them. that's all that really matters
to me. six things important to me?<br />
good relationship with my kids<br />
dinner parties w/ great conversation<br />
being on/next to water<br />

life with purpose<br />
a confident, grounded, affectionate, spontaneous soul mate that i
honor, respect and love deeply<br />
is that six?","my work. i am at the ramp up stage so i have a lot to think about.","honestly, friday's catch up with me. i love planning and looking
forward to my weekends but i'm new to the area and find myself
thinking how great it would be to have a soul mate to go do
something fun. sounds sweet and pathetic, don't you think? so if i
promise to not be a lunatic, i'd love to plan doing something with
you one of these weekends.","i can be a real task oriented person and with the launch of my new
business i have neglected my exercise. i have put on a few unwanted
pounds and i am looking forward to having more balance and a
partner that loves to do physical activities.<br />
<br />
on another note, i am a very goal oriented person. i like to set
ambitious goals but have recently come to the conclusion that i
don't really enjoy fulfilling them on my own. i have determined
that i want a partner to share in ""our"" life's goals, hers, mine,
ours. if you don't really care about making a difference, leaving a
footprint, we are most likely not a good match.","you have learned from your lessons in life and we don't need to
share unnecessary drama together. i'm pretty healthy in all ways. i
want someone who is affectionate, communicates honestly without
hidden agendas, playful, spontaneous, young for your age,
spiritual, goal oriented, and likes kids of all ages. because like
it or not, i come as a package. i adore my children and want them
to have a loving, mutually-respectful, accepting relationship with
my significant other. . . and i want the same with her children.","white",73,-1,"","2012-06-10-21-43","san rafael, california","has kids","straight","has dogs","other and somewhat serious about it","m","capricorn and it&rsquo;s fun to think about","no","english","single"

my life philosophy: when i was a kid, i tended to be a little more
of a thinking kid, trying to figure out what i wanted to do with my
life, the meaning of life, why different cultures have different
attitudes towards race, school, etc., and a lot more. nowadays,
i've simplified and silo my life into completely separate spheres-
family/friends/people i deeply care about, work/career, a few core
career/personal interests, and everything (prioritized in that
order). i kind of realized at some point in high school that life
is short, and i wanted to do things in my career/life that would
make the lives of the next generation better. this meant that i
needed to focus and simplify my life, and that's what led to the
silo-ing. so outwardly, i may sound completely articulate and seem
to have very particular interests, but the ""thinking kid"" in me is
still there, it's just silo-ed into the ""everything"" category! hope
that makes sense.","dinner with friends","i'm a star trek fan. i don't watch it anymore, but the other day, i

i am pretty good in most situations. i have friends who are

think stands out above the rest. i enjoy most things, and i am
usually willing to try something new.","it really depends on the situation. i tend to be more of an

i'll rely on what others have told me. i've been told i'm a nice

(b) by far the answer is ""miller's crossing"" by the coen brothers.
i have declared a campaign of active dislike against anyone who
harbors ill thoughts against this movie. if you're one, i'll ferret

at base i am earnest, open-minded and kind. i like depth,
listening, and people who take a long time to figure out.<br />
<br />
my pictures make it look like i am a steve martin style
wild-and-crazy guy. it's not a bad comparison if you actually know
what that character is about -- a flamboyant/hedonistic exterior
that genuinely reflects a love of life but that also covers up for
some amount of shyness/tenderness/insecurity.<br />

i'll put it another way. my dad is humble, decent, and a little
melancholy and my mom has a secret penchant for glee. add water and
stir: me.<br />

over many years i have assembled a palace of art supplies and this
is basically the (non-human) love of my life. the latest product of
this palace is an obsession with stop-motion animation created from
thousands of individually decorated velcro dots.<br />

i am really into sorting and categorizing.<br />

i am a dancing dancing dancing machine, though unfortunately i
don't do it as much as i used to. mostly electronica, hip-hop and
other flavors of booty music. ever been to ""prince vs mj""? i own
that joint.<br />

too geeky to mention in print.<br />

i have dressed up as larry bird approximately 23 times.","i am doing two *very* different things with my life. at some point
i will have to choose...<br />
<br />
1. i do tons of art of many varieties. it is just starting to make
it into the out-side world: my first stop-motion short has played
in a bunch of film festivals around the country.<br />
<br />
2. at work i create visualizations for genome sequence data. this
sounds very high-falutin, but the truth is that i am sort of
coasting on tech skills and a fancy degree while i devote my
energies elsewhere (see above).<br />
<br />
3. i have a ton of fun. i dance in my apartment. i play some geeky
board and card games. (and the usual ones too. every third post
talks about ""i'll kick your ass in scrabble."" relinquish this
foolish notion. you will not kick my ass in scrabble). i try not to
watch too much tv, but it's hard because, honestly, tv is really
good these days.<br />

would-be smartypants. in some rarest of settings, just smartypants.
and perhaps one day, having finally rid myself of all decorum,
smarty no-pants.<br />
<br />
i suppose i believe in appreciating and embracing one's own
sentimentality without letting it run completely amok, perhaps
trying to guide it inch by inch - sometimes through play, sometimes
through a little extra oomph - to something more attuned with the
things we truly want and need. what does that mean? maybe it means
that where i'm at right now is this: to escape blank stares and
dead air, i will sometimes pretend that i am flailing a whiffle bat
and riding a tricycle into battle at the bottom of the ocean with a
regiment of all my heroes led by malalai joya and optimus prime
(the o.g. one, natch).<br />
<br />
i've gotten to be a bit health-obsessed in the last few years,
mostly out of necessity and working w/personal challenges. i
exercise (i really like this program called circular strength
training), do tai chi, and meditate on the regular. i'm pleased
because i feel like i've found the variants that seem to energize
&amp; heal for me without feeling like rote practice or hard
discipline.<br />
<br />
i'm a total stickler about what i eat and will spend a lot on food
(without, of course, expecting others to do the same or really
agree w/ my pov) - good quality animal fat and produce is what it's
about for me. respect to vegans and veg folks, but i'm not yet
convinced that that's what's best for all people or the
planet.<br />
<br />
though i don't do the drink no mores, i miss it a touch and enjoy
hanging out with entertaining lushes.<br />
<br />
aside from snarky and stimulating banter with friends, (sometimes)
strangers, myself, and (allegedly) inanimate objects, decent movies
and tv are the favored form of escapism for me - the high falutin
stuff and the low brow. standard disclaimer of always trying to
improve the escapism to constructively-engaged-ism ratio applies.
(so does the meta-disclaimer of seeing mixed results there).<br />
<br />
a whole lotta what passes for entertainment and modern culture
alternately drives me to hysterics or makes me spittin mad. like
most, i appreciate the bay area and sf for its variety and all of
its locally-produced food, art, music, and the like, but i will cop
to fantasizing a good amount about heading for the hills and trying
to do for some greatly simplified countrylivin.","i'm an office monkey for a really excellent non-profit and do some
volunteering on the side. cooking, exercising, live music, hiking,
extended bs sessions on politics, movies, the parallels and

else. when i manage to get past that:<br />
<br />
i do my best to pay attention to politics and have at least a
slight grasp on relevant issues. i think progressives and
libertarians should spend a lot more time together. it's tough not
to feel a lot of the time like humanity is rushing headlong into
self-annihilation, that when it all shakes out, we're just too
fraught with manipulation and avarice and distractability to make
it. likely not a swoon-inducing admission, that one, but it is what
it is. (doesn't mean i've given up trying to make it better in
whatever infinitesimal way that i can).<br />
<br />
in the last few years, i've spent some time looking at and
experimenting w/a lot of alternative ideas about health. like with
a lot of things, i think the conventional wisdom about nutrition
&amp; medicine is seriously off-track and heavily distorted by
commercial interests. i've had some longstanding chronic issues
that have been improved by dedicated self-care and am keen to keep
things going further in that direction.<br />
<br />
along with the general health bit goes directing a little more
attention these days towards the mind's role in all this. doing
autogenic training exercises, trying to access and observe more
obscure levels of consciousness, and just not writing off stuff
that i used to think was bonkers has, perhaps, started to yield a
few tidbits of discovery and wonderfulness.","probably taking it relatively easy, owing to sat am

lately i have been really into nutrition. like on a scientific
level. i have been experimenting with the crock pot quite a bit and
making some very tasty and wholesome meals. it's amazing how much
better i feel and how much extra energy i have from eating nice big
spinach salads with fresh organic veggies from the mexi-mart and
farmers markets. perhaps the best part about it is saving all that
$$ i was spending eating out all the time :-) there is no
replacement for a balanced, high fiber, high protein, lower carb
diet with plenty of vegetables.","affixing things to the wall, breathing, eating, sleeping, crying

addicted to fear &amp; loathing... mainly i watch documentaries and
foodie series like anthony bourdain/the layover, diners drive-in's

entourage, sons of anarchy, mad men, the league and of course
workaholics :-) i love any live music (especially multi-day outdoor
festivals - this year i went to the outside lands and austin city
limits festivals). i do not discriminate - i pretty much like all
music (even classical and country) tho i'm mostly into a vast and
eclectic mix of rock, rap, house, funk, classic rock - is it really
80's music now? that just makes me feel old :-/ i want to eat
everything especially if its foreign and i've never had it
before.<br />
<br />
i was absolutely obsessed with the ""seattle sound"" growing up. i
still love soundgarden, pearl jam, alice in chains, mother love

<br />
i feel like i have been through so many phases and they are now
becoming cyclical with regards to my musical tastes. however, on
another token there is so much music that is absolutely timeless. i
certainly appreciate the classics and well as being exposed to new
music.<br />
<br />
for me some music that i will never get sick of is the doors, david
byrne / talking heads, led zeppelin, neil young, rush, pink floyd,

my life right now has been primarily routine lately (work, eat,

this with periodic activities with friends and/or family (and once
in awhile strictly by my lonesome). i understand there are a lot of
things i still haven't done in my life (i.e. i have debated about

when accompanying others.","taking long walks, going to the gym, watching movies (mostly

as to music i guess you can say i like the genres easy listening
and soft rock. my favorite musical artist include abba, air supply,
carpenters, elton john, linda ronstadt, sarah mclachlan and
stylistics (i guess i'm stuck primarily in the 70s or 80s).<br />

46,"average","","socially","","graduated from college/university","i like authenticity in general, people who are genuine and
thoughtful and sincere in their approach to life. that's how i'd
describe myself, and that's who i prefer to be around. i live very
simply, but have a complex, and rich inner existence. i guess most
artists are that way. i've spent most my life in pursuit of art in
one form or another, but for the past number of years it's been
writing. i've yet to get where i want to go with it, but i'm still
trying.<br />
<br />
frankly, i find these things difficult--filling out questions about
myself. and in fact it's not like me to even be on a site like
this, given how i began this summary. i much prefer meeting women
in person, in the moment, when you can feel an energy and
attraction for one another, or not, and proceed accordingly as the
rest organically evolves. that to me is real and natural, that's
what i mean by authentic. but i must acknowledge it is getting
harder to meet people this way these days, and so here i am to give
this a try. in a nutshell i'd say i'm a respectful, insightful, and
sensitive male, who is feeling it a bit too lonely these days on my
own in this gorgeous city inhabited by so many beautiful women, and
i think it's time for a change. i think i should have someone to go
to see that film with, or that band, or that museum exhibit, or to
join me for mexican dinner and margaritas, or for that weekend
trip, for that picnick in the park, whatever...i think it's time...","striving to stay true to my own nature and path, to learn the
deeper lessons life has to teach, to retain as much soul as
possible from the clutches of this very greedy and distracting
world, to create.","oh lots of things, aesthetic perception for one. i have a good
design and style sense. and i'm really good at observing and
reading people. i make a really good pizza. and there are other
things too, best um kept to the sensual imagination...","my eyes i guess, and maybe my gentle quiet demeanor.","","this is an example of lists i dislike","living in europe","doing any number of things, having drinks, seeing a movie, walking

49,"athletic","anything","socially","","graduated from law school","i like to laugh and try not to take myself too seriously. i've had
a lot of interesting jobs, including working in politics,
practicing law, writing speeches, being a management consultant,
and promoting gay rights as executive director of a nonprofit. i've
studied classical voice and piano and performed a fair amount. i'm
told i'm thoughtful and insightful and that i come across as warm
and open. i aspire to be kind all of the time. qualities i'd like
in a partner: sincere and honest, enjoys kids, enjoys discussing
ideas, politically progressive, can communicate his feelings.","i'm a single, full-time, lucky dad of a delightful three-year-old.
my job involves helping nonprofit agencies implement technology to
manage their programs. i moved to berkeley a couple of years ago
and am focused on nesting and building community.","singing, facilitating meetings, writing, analysis.","not sure.","all time favorite books include: for lyrical beauty, atonement and
lolita; for turns of phrase, the mill on the floss and the naked
civil servant; for sheer influence, a theory of justice.<br />

i enjoy movies but tend to forget them quickly. i generally don't
track celebrities such as actors, sports figures, musicians,
etc.<br />

i love to eat and cook and have the immense privilege of living a
few blocks from berkeley bowl.<br />
<br />
music is a big part of my life. i get together sometimes with a
pianist friend to sing jazz standards and bossa nova. lately i'm
playing a lot of piano - haydn, mozart, beethoven, bach. a also
play guitar, mostly to entertain myself and small children. i love
alfred deller, a countertenor who specialized in folk songs of the
british isles, and i think karen carpenter was brilliant. i adore a
good tune, but my ears are also tickled by dissonance.","family<br />

out. i'm at a stage in life where i'm jonesing for the opportunity
to explore more of what life and the world has to offer. but i take
pretty much everything in stride and roll with whatever comes my
way. i operate under the theory that if i do my best to stay

probably will.","attending city college with the intention of eventually
